Abstract

The soil nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is frequently used in ecotoxicological studies due to its wide distribution in
terrestrial habitats, its easy handling in the laboratory, and its sensitivity against diﬀerent kinds of stress. Since its gen-
ome has been completely sequenced, more and more studies are investigating the functional relation of gene expression
and phenotypic response. For these reasons C. elegans seems to be an attractive animal for the development of a new,
genome based, ecotoxicological test system. In recent years, the DNA array technique has been established as a pow-
erful tool to obtain distinct gene expression patterns in response to diﬀerent experimental conditions. Using a C. elegans
whole genome DNA microarray in this study, the eﬀects of ﬁve diﬀerent xenobiotics on the gene expression of the nem-
atode were investigated. The exposure time for the following ﬁve applied compounds b-NF (5 mg/l), Fla (0.5 mg/l),
atrazine (25 mg/l), cloﬁbrate (10 mg/l) and DES (0.5 mg/l) was 48 ± 5 h. The analysis of the data showed a clear induc-
tion of 203 genes belonging to diﬀerent families like the cytochromes P450, UDP-glucoronosyltransferases (UDPGT),
glutathione S-transferases (GST), carboxylesterases, collagenes, C-type lectins and others. Under the applied condi-
tions, ﬂuoranthene was able to induce most of the induceable genes, followed by cloﬁbrate, atrazine, b-naphthoﬂavone
and diethylstilbestrol. A decreased expression could be shown for 153 genes with atrazine having the strongest eﬀect
followed by ﬂuoranthene, diethylstilbestrol, b-naphthoﬂavone and cloﬁbrate. For upregulated genes a change ranging
from approximately 2.1- till 42.3-fold and for downregulated genes from approximately 2.1 till 6.6-fold of gene expres-
sion could be aﬀected through the applied xenobiotics. The results conﬁrm the applicability of the gene expression for
the development of an ecotoxicological test system. Compared to classical tests the main advantages of this new
approach will be the increased sensitivity and itÕs potential for a substance class speciﬁc eﬀect determination as well
as the large numbers of genes that can be screened rapidly at the same time and the selection of well regulated marker
genes to study more in detail.

environmental concentrations decreased reproduction
and increased mortality are successfully used to deﬁne
toxicity. But what about lower concentrated contami-
nants? In these cases often no signiﬁcant eﬀects could
be found using classical test endpoints. The aim of this
study is to investigate whether the xenobiotically in-
duced gene expression of Caenorhabditis elegans could
be a suitable tool to develop a screening system for envi-
ronmental pollution. This new approach has the poten-
tial of a substance class speciﬁc response and should be
more sensitive than classical ecotoxicological tests.

C. elegans is a member of the Rhabditidae, a large
and diverse group of nematodes found in terrestrial hab-
itats. Living in the pore water of the soil, the nematode is
in direct contact with the dissolved pollutants. Due to its
size, it can be handled like a microorganism, while oﬀer-
ing the features of a multicellular animal. Its genome has
been completely sequenced (The C. elegans Sequencing
Consortium, 1998). Thus C. elegans provides the re-
searcher with the ideal compromise between complexity
and easy handling.

Since the late 1980s the nematode has been frequently
used in ecotoxicological studies. The range of these stud-
ies covers reproduction, growth, movement and feeding
tests (Van Kessel et al., 1988; Donkin and Dusenbery,
1993; Hitchcock et al., 1997; Traunspurger et al., 1997;
Anderson et al., 2001; Ho¨ ss et al., 2001), as well as the
construction of transgenic strains for the monitoring of
environmental stress in living worms (Jones et al.,
1996; Mutwakil et al., 1997; David et al., 2003). Here
the increased hsp-16 gene expression, inducible by diﬀer-
ent kinds of stress, demonstrated for the ﬁrst time in C.
elegans the potential of the gene expression response for
ecotoxicological studies.

More recently the DNA array technique has been
used to investigate the whole genomic gene expression
of C. elegans (for an overview see Kim et al., 2001).
Important examples are the investigations of diﬀeren-
tially expressed genes during development (Jiang et al.,
2001) and aging (Lund et al., 2002), as well as the proﬁl-
ing of germline (Reinke et al., 2000) and dauer gene
expression (Wang and Kim, 2003). All these studies con-
ﬁrmed the excellent reliability of the C. elegans whole
genome DNA microarray created in Stuart KimÕs labo-
ratory (Stanford University, USA).

The aim of this study was to investigate the suitabil-
ity of this microarray for a toxicological approach. Five
diﬀerent xenobiotics representing a broad range of sub-
stance classes (the herbicide atrazine, the PAHs b-napht-
hoﬂavone and ﬂuoranthene, the drug cloﬁbrate and the
endocrine active substance diethylstilbestrol) were used
to obtain information about diﬀerentially expressed
genes and to draw a gene expression proﬁle in depen-
dence of the tested xenobiotic compound. Particularly
interesting were gene families from which it is already
known that members take part in phase I and II of the

biotransformation system in vertebrates, e.g. the cyto-
chrome P450 genes (CYP), UDP-glucoronosyltransfe-
rases (UDPGT), glutathione S-transferases (GST) or
carboxylesterases (Satoh and Hosokawa, 1998; King
et al., 2000; Sheweita, 2000; Bartosiewicz et al., 2001;
Board et al., 2001; Schuetz, 2001; McClain et al.,
2002). These genes have been particularly implicated in
the biotransformation of many drugs and xenobiotics.
The genome of C. elegans contains 80 cytochrome
P450 genes, 23 UDPGT genes, about 36 GST and 17
carboxylesterases genes (data available using the euGene
database: http://iubio.bio.indiana.edu:8089/worm/).

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Strain and cultivation

In this study the wild-type C. elegans Bristol strain
(N2) was used. The nematodes were cultured in liquid
medium at 20 °C as described by Brenner (1974) and
Sulston and Hodgkin (1988), using freeze-dried Esche-
richia coli OP50 as food source. The cultures were syn-
chronized by treatment with sodium hypochlorite
(Emmons et al., 1979). Each culture was started with
around 3 million nematodes in the L1 larvae-stage.
Worms were harvested in the young adult stage,
48 ± 5 h after induction with the xenobiotic substance.

2.2. Treatment

The diﬀerent xenobiotics, dissolved in DMSO, were
added to the medium 24 h after starting the culture.
The applied concentration was the calculated EC10
value for inhibition of reproduction (Menzel et al., 2001).
The following ﬁve compounds were applied: b-NF
(5 mg/l), Fla (0.5 mg/l), atrazine (25 mg/l), cloﬁbrate
(10 mg/l) and DES (0.5 mg/l). The ﬁnal concentration
of DMSO in the medium of the controls and the samples
was 0.5%, v/v.

2.3. RNA preparation

The cell breakage was performed by homogenization
with glass beads, subsequently total RNA was extracted
using a RNeasy kit (Qiagen). To improve the results of
the hybridization on the microarray, the method was
changed and total RNA was extracted using Trizol
(Invitrogen) (Chomczynski and Sacchi, 1987) resulting
in higher yields of better quality RNA. Poly(A)+ RNA
was puriﬁed using an Oligotex mRNA kit (Qiagen).

2.4. C. elegans whole genome DNA microarray

RNA samples as well as the production and hybridiza-

tion of the microarrays was kindly performed in the lab-
oratory of Stuart Kim (Stanford University, CA). The
labelling of the samples was done with Cy3-dUTP (Amer-
sham) for the control samples and with Cy5-dUTP
(Amersham) for samples treated with the xenobiotic (Re-
inke et al., 2000). The hybridization was done in hybrid-
ization chambers (Monterey Industries, Ca.) for 20 h in a
water bath at 65 °C. Dye swaps have not been performed.
The data from the experiments were loaded in the Stan-
ford Microarray database
(http://genome-
www.stanford.edu/microarray). As described by other
authors (Coller et al., 2000; Bartosiewicz et al., 2001; Lar-
kin et al., 2003) only genes whose up- or down-regulation
was equal or above 2-fold compared with controls were
considered, the normalization of the data were performed
according to Sherlock et al. (2001). The induction data
are presented as mean ± SEM from all experiments per-
formed for every xenobiotic used.

(SMD)

For each exposure to a xenobiotic poly(A)+ RNA
was prepared from three independent cultures of C. ele-
gans including control cultures and each used in an
independent array experiment, with exception of the
inducers atrazine, Fla and DES. For atrazine and Fla
poly(A)+ RNA was prepared from four independent cul-
tures, and for DES from two and each used in an inde-
pendent array experiment.

2.5. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR

Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was used for conﬁrma-
tion of selected genes. To synthesize cDNA poly(A)+
RNA was incubated with oligo (dT) and M-MLV re-
verse transcriptase (PROMEGA, Germany) at 42 °C
for 90 min. In a ﬁrst step a PCR ampliﬁcation of the ac-
tin cDNA act-1 (T04C12.6) was performed (with the
HotStar Taq DNA polymerase system from QIAGEN,
30 cycles). The primers for ampliﬁcation were act1-1
(50 GAGGCCCAATCCAAGAGA 30) and act1-2 (50
TGTTGGAAGGTGGAGAGG 30). To quantify ampli-
ﬁed DNA the PCR reactions were separated in an aga-
rose gel and imaged using an AlphaImager 2200
(Alpha Innotech Corp., USA). The appropriate cDNA
dilutions were empirically determined to ensure that
the PCR ampliﬁcation of act-1 cDNA, as well as of each
CYP35 cDNA, did not reach saturation. Always a cali-
bration curve was constructed with known amounts of a
commercial DNA mass standard (QuantStandard, Gen-
sura). In the next step the cDNA amounts used for the
CYP35 PCRs were determined, calculating the act-1
cDNA amount as internal standard. The CYP35 PCRs
were performed like the act-1 PCRs (for the CYP35 gene
speciﬁc primers see Menzel et al., 2001). To minimize
potential variations relative data are presented as a ratio
between the speciﬁcally ampliﬁed CYP cDNA and act-1
as internal reference. Each experiment was performed
three times.

3. Results

3.1. Inducer and solvent selection

The selected xenobiotics included several ecotoxico-
logical relevant substances, the PAH ﬂuoranthene, the
herbicide atrazine, the endocrine disrupter diethylstilbes-
trol, and cloﬁbrate, an active ingredient of antidiuretic
and antihyperlipidemic drugs. In addition, the potent
and well known inducer of phase I and II enzymes of
the biotransformation system b-NF, was used. Due to
the hydrophobic nature of most of the selected com-
pounds, they had to be dissolved in an organic solvent.
C. elegans can tolerate modest amounts of common sol-
vents, so <2% DMSO has little eﬀect on growth or
behaviour (Rand and Johnson, 1995). Goldstein and
Magnano (1988) showed that treatment of C. elegans
with <2.0% DMSO has no eﬀect on the fecundity, viabil-
ity and ultrastructure of the gametes. In this study
DMSO at a ﬁnal concentration of only 0.5% (v/v) in
the medium was used.

3.2. Xenobiotically induced transcriptional regulation

Using the C. elegans whole genome array it could be
shown that 203 of total 17 815 genes on the array were
inducible under the applied conditions. As the strongest
inducer based on number of regulated genes Fla was
found with 79 overexpressed genes. Induction with cloﬁ-
brate resulted in an overexpression of 53 genes, in case
of atrazine 52 and b-NF 40 genes. The weakest inducer
in this study was DES, which induced eight genes only.
From the 203 overexpressed genes only 26 were induc-
ible by more than one xenobiotic, precisely 23 genes
by two and three genes by three diﬀerent xenobiotics.
These genes are marked with an asterisk in Table 1.
As expected several families were found which are
known to be involved in biotransformation of xenobio-
tics, e.g. the cytochrome P450 superfamily (CYP). In this
study, nine CYP genes could be shown as inducible, b-
NF was revealed as the strongest inducer, followed by
atrazine (Table 1). The vem-1 gene (cytochrome b5)
could be induced by cloﬁbrate and b-NF (Table 1).
The GST family was represented by four genes, each
of them inducible by a diﬀerent xenobiotic (Table 1).
In case of the UDPGT and the carboxylesterases family,
three genes of each family were overexpressed again with
b-NF and atrazine as the strongest inducers (Table 1).
Cloﬁbrate was able to induce one gene of each family,
whereas no induction was seen for DES and Fla (Table
1). The UDPGT AC3.7 was inducible through atrazine,
cloﬁbrate and b-NF.

Besides the four already mentioned gene families fur-
ther 61 genes, which encode proteins belong to diﬀerent
metabolic pathways, were overexpressed. Thirty six of
them were found to be inducible by Fla, 12 by cloﬁbrate,

11 by atrazine and by b-NF, as well as two by DES. Two
of these 61 genes, C44H4.3 (sym-1) and K11G9.6, the
metallothionein mtl-1, were induced both by cloﬁbrate
and b-NF (the detailed results are not shown here).

In addition, 92 genes of still unknown function were
found to be inducible by at least one of the used xenobi-
otic. 35 of these genes were induced by Fla, 28 by atra-
zine, 19 by cloﬁbrate and 15 by b-NF. From the total 92
genes six were inducible by two diﬀerent and two genes
by three diﬀerent xenobiotics. The detailed results are
not shown here, but can be found as raw data in the
SMD.

Twenty four genes of the collagen gene superfamily
were also overexpressed after xenobiotic treatment
(Table 2). 17 collagene genes were induced by cloﬁbrate
and in each case three diﬀerent genes by atrazine, Fla
and b-NF (Table 2). As another unexpected group of
genes, C-type lectins were detected as inducible. From
the six induced genes two were inducible by atrazine
and another two by Fla, one gene was induced by cloﬁ-
brate (Table 2). The C-type lectin gene Y19D10A.J was
inducible by atrazine and Fla.

For 153 genes a downregulation was found. Atrazine
eﬀected the underexpression of 140 genes, followed by
Fla decreasing the expression of nine genes, DES of se-
ven, b-NF of two and cloﬁbrate of only one gene. As
shown in Table 3, 43 of the downregulated genes belong

to already classiﬁed gene families, e.g. to the vitelloge-
nine in case of K09F5.2 (vit-1) and K07H8.6 (vit-6),
the heat shock protein family (F43D9.4), the cyto-
chrome P450 family (C36A4.1) and more. The further
110 genes of still unknown function were found to be
downregulated by at least one of the used xenobiotics.
The detailed results are not shown here, but can be
found as raw data in the SMD.

Three genes (F26H9.5, coding for an aminotransfer-
ase, K08F4.7, a glutathione S-transferase and C39E.9.2,
a member of the SCP-like extracellular protein family)
were found as over- and underexpressed by diﬀerent
xenobiotics. F26H9.5 and C39E9.2 were overexpressed
by DES and underexpressed by atrazine, K08F4.7 was
overexpressed by DES, too, but underexpressed by Fla
and atrazine. From the 153 underexpressed genes only
two genes (F32A5.5 and K08F4.7) were downregulated
by two xenobiotics, atrazine and Fla.

3.3. Concentration dependent induction of CYP gene
expression

To conﬁrm the DNA array results with an indepen-
dent method, in each case three independent semi-quan-
titative RT-PCRs were performed. In this assay the
xenobiotic b-NF elicited a strong and reproducible
induction of CYP35A1, A2 and C1 gene expression

for all used concentrations. Fig. 1a presents for every
individual CYP35 form a typical DNA agarose gel
showing the induction of gene expression. In addition,
for every experiment a gel representing the level of act-1
expression was added for control purposes. It is obvious
that the raising concentration of xenobiotic substance
did not eﬀect the actin gene expression, whereas the
expression of all CYP35 genes increased in a concentra-
tion dependent manner. The semi-quantitative evalua-
tion of all data results in Fig. 1b.

4. Discussion

Many xenobiotics found in the environment are sus-
pected to have a negative eﬀect on human or wildlife
health. Due to their often low concentration it is hard
to ﬁnd a correlation between their occurrence and a phe-
notypical eﬀect of a test organism, even when using reli-
able ecotoxicological endpoints such as mortality or
reproduction. In this study the eﬀect of ﬁve diﬀerent
xenobiotic compounds to the C. elegans whole genome

gene expression was investigated. Using concentrations
corresponding to the EC10 value for reproduction it
was possible to show that a strong and diﬀerential gene
induction or repression was detectable in response to the
used substance.

In detail, this investigation demonstrated that genes,
coding for proteins probably taking part in phase I and
II of the biotransformation system (e.g. CYP, UDPGT,
GST and carboxylesterases genes) are inducible by the
used xenobiotic compounds. Whereas in vertebrates the
metabolic role of many of these enzymes is well under-
stood, their biological function in C. elegans is still un-
known. In a previous study,
the potential of 18
diﬀerent xenobiotics to induce the gene expression of
nematode CYP genes was investigated systematically
(Menzel et al., 2001). It could be demonstrated that in
particular CYP35 forms are strongly induced by PAHs,
PCBs and diﬀerent drugs. Our results obtained with
b-NF and atrazine as inducers conﬁrm this study. In
addition, CYP37B1 (F28G4.1) was found to be over
expressed using progesterone as
(Custodia
et al., 2001) as well by Fla in this study. CYP35B2

(K07C6.3), however, was found to be suppressed by pro-
gesterone (Custodia et al., 2001), where it was overex-
pressed by atrazine in this study.

Moreover, a couple of further genes identiﬁed in this
study were already known as inducible by xenobiotics,
too. Tawe et al. (1998) proved gst-4 (K08F4.7) to be
inducible by paraquat, where it was overexpressed by
DES and underexpressed by atrazine and Fla in this
study. The GST gene F56A.4I was found to be sup-
pressed by progesterone (Custodia et al., 2001), but
overexpressed by cloﬁbrate in this study. From the
group of the 61 genes which encode proteins belonging

to diﬀerent metabolic pathways, the metallothionein
mtl-1 was found to be inducible by cloﬁbrate and b-
NF in our study as well as by progesterone (Custodia
et al., 2001) and cadmium (Liao and Freedman, 1998).
In case of the C-type lectin and collagene genes it is
unclear what physiological meaning the overexpression
has. The physiological function of the C-type lectins is
correlated to the immune defense (Jasmer et al., 2001;
Mallo et al., 2002). An activation of the immune defense
system might be an answer to the presence of xenobiot-
ics in the culture medium. The collagene genes are in-
volved, among other functions, in the formation of the

cuticle constituting the barrier between the animal and
its
(Johnstone, 1994, 2000; Kramer,
1994). An overexpression of these genes due to xenobi-
otic exposure might be related to the protection of the
nematode against xenobiotics in its environment. The
vitellogenine genes K09F5.2 (vit-1) and K07H8.6 (vit-
6) were found to be downregulated in this study, where
as Custodia et al. (2001) showed only vit-6 as downreg-
ulated and vit-1 overexpressed by progestrone.

Using the semi-quantitative RT-PCR as an indepen-
dent method, the array results were veriﬁed for three
genes. Receiving nearly equal results in both methods
for these three genes would place stronger conﬁdence
in the whole genome array evaluation (Gerhold et al.,
2001; Vondracek et al., 2002). The observed increase
of CYP35A1, A2 and C1 gene expression induced by
ß-NF conﬁrms the array results for these three genes.
For a better veriﬁcation of the array results even more
genes should be investigated with RT-PCR. Moreover,
the concentration dependent RT-PCR assay reveals the
lowest eﬀect level of xenobiotically induced gene expres-
sion as 50 times lower than the concentration actually
used in the array experiments.

As shown in this study a distinct gene expression pat-
tern can be obtained in response to the compound used
for exposure. Moreover, the DNA array technique al-
lows the high throughput necessary for a ecotoxicologi-
cal test system. But not every nematode laboratory will
be able to perform whole genome DNA microarray
experiments. With the selection of about 100 strongly
inducible genes for a new low density array, however,
the system will be much easier to handle, especially in re-
spect to the evaluation of the data. It is obvious that
members of the CYP family, the UDPGTs, the GSTs,
and carboxylesterases as well as collagene and C-type
lectin genes should be included in such a selection of
inducible genes. Among the group of genes which en-
code proteins belonging to diﬀerent metabolic pathways
at least the metallothionein mtl-1 should be included in

the gene selection, too. In addition it might be of interest
to consider also the induction potential of other xenobi-
otics than those used in this study and to include genes
responding to a more general stress. The vitellogenin
genes, for example, are induced by endocrine disrupting
compounds (Kohra et al., 1999; Custodia et al., 2001)
and the heat shock genes by diﬀerent kinds of stress
(Candido et al., 1989; Heschl and Baillie, 1989).

In summary, this investigation is able to show that
the xenobiotically induced gene expression of C. elegans
is a tool to detect the response to pollutants on the tran-
scriptional level. This system has in contrast to already
established classical ecotoxicological test systems the po-
tential of a substance class speciﬁc eﬀect determination
depending on the selected marker genes, as well as it is
a more sensitive approach as standard ecotoxicological
tests like reproduction or mortality even so the used con-
centrations are still rather high and may not be relevant
environmentally. Based on new genome sequencing pro-
jects (e.g. by the Daphnia Genomics Consortium) the
application of the xenobiotically induced gene expres-
sion to more sensitive species will considerably enlarge
the implementation of microarrays in ecotoxicology.
