Nematicidal bioassay-guided fractionation of the n-hexane extract of the seeds of Jubaea
chilensis led to the identification of eight known fatty acids and a mixture of triglycerides,
reported for the first time for this species. In addition, their corresponding methyl esters
were identified to be artifacts generated during the extraction and isolation procedures by
using GC-EI-MS and chemical transformation methods. The fatty acid composition of the
triglycerides was analyzed by GC-EI-MS and chemical transformation techniques. Among
the 17 compounds, only lauric acid and myristic acid exhibited significant inhibitory effects
on the movement of Caenorhabditis elegans with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC)
of 75 µg/ml.

Introduction

Jubaea chilensis (Molina) Baill. (Arecaceae)
commonly known as “Chilean wine palm”, “co-
quito palm”, or “honey palm” is an evergreen
palm tree with mighty straight trunk up to ~ 25 m
in height (Mabberley, 1997). This species indige-
nous to the coastal areas of central Chile also
grows in areas with Mediterranean climates, such
as California, the southern European coast and
South Africa. Its sweet fruits, seeds, and sap have
been used in sweetmeats, candies and wine. An
edible oil can also be obtained from its seeds. Up
to the present, no phytochemical and biological
studies have been reported for this plant. As part
of a collaborative search for novel bioactive prin-
ciples of plant and microbial organisms from dry-
land biodiversity of Latin America (Timmermann
et al., 1999), the MeOH extract of the seeds of J.
chilensis exhibited significant inhibitory effects on
the growth of Caenorhabditis elegans with a mini-
mum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 600 µg/ml.
Nematicidal bioassay-guided fractionation of this
extract led to the identification of eight known
fatty acids (1Ð8) and their corresponding methyl

esters (1aÐ8a) (Fig. 1), along with a mixture of tri-
glycerides. We report herein the identification of
these compounds by GC-EI-MS and chemical
transformation techniques, their inhibitory effects
on the movement of C. elegans, and an investiga-
tion into the possible artifactual nature of 1aÐ8a.

Materials and Methods
General experimental procedures

Linoleic, oleic, palmitic,

stearic acids were
purchased from Fisher Scientific (Houston, Texas,
USA) while capric, lauric, myristic, and octanoic
acids were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Milwau-
kee, Wisconsin, USA). GC-EI-MS data were ob-
tained with a Varian Saturn 2100T GC-MS Work-
station (Varian, Lake Forest, California, USA)
including a data system software (Version 5.2)
interfaced to a 3900-GC, a 2000-MS detector, and
a 1079-injector. The gas chromatograph was fitted
with a WCOT Fused Silica Chrompack capillary
column packed with CP Sil 8 CB (30 m ¥
0.25 mm). Ultra pure helium at 1.2 ml/min was
used as the carrier gas, and the injector, transfer
line, and trap temperatures were 250 ∞C, 250 ∞C,

and 200 ∞C, respectively. The temperature of the
column oven was programmed at 80 ∞C for 5 min,
and then to 280 ∞C at 10 ∞C/min, followed by
280 ∞C for 20 min. NMR spectra were recorded in
CDCl3 at room temperature on a Bruker Avance
300 NMR spectrometer in 5-mm NMR tubes with
TMS as the internal standard. Column chromato-
graphy (CC) was conducted on silica gel (63Ð
200 µm, Scientific Adsorbents Incorporated, At-
lanta, Georgia, USA). A middle pressure LC
(MPLC) system was set up with a Büchi 688 chro-
matography pump (Büchi Labortechnik AG,
Flawil, Switzerland), a Büchi Borosilikat 3.3 glass
column (2 ¥ 45 cm) packed with C18 Packing silica
gel (15 g, 5 µm, Aldrich, Milwaukee, Wisconsin,
USA), and a Spectra/Chrom“ CF-1 fraction col-
lector (Spectrum Chromatography Inc., Houston,
Texas, USA). Analytical TLC was performed on
Whatman Diamond K6F silica gel 60A (250 µm)
and Merck RP-18 WF254S (200 µm) plates. Com-
pounds were visualized on TLC plates by dipping
in anisaldehyde or vanillin-sulfuric acid reagents
followed by charring at 110 ∞C for 5Ð10 min.

Plant material

Seeds of J. chilensis were identified and col-
lected in May 2000 in Palmar de Ocoa, V Regio´ n,
Chile (32∞ 55⬘ S; 71∞ 2⬘ W) by Gloria Montenegro.
A voucher specimen (No. 1009) has been depos-
ited in the herbarium at the Pontificia Universidad
Cato´ lica de Chile, Santiago, Chile. Intellectual
Property Rights Agreements for plant collections
and collaborative research have been fully exe-
cuted between the University of Arizona and Pon-
tificia Universidad Cato´ lica de Chile.

Extraction and isolation

The milled and dried seeds (650 g) were ex-
tracted by maceration with MeOH (4 ¥ 2.0 l).
After filtration and evaporation of the solvent
in vacuo, the resultant extract was diluted with
H2O to afford a 90% aqueous MeOH solution
(0.55 l) and then partitioned with n-hexane (3 ¥
0.55 l) and CH2Cl2/H2O (1:1 v/v, 2 ¥ 1.2 l), sequen-
tially, to afford dried n-hexane-soluble (75 g) and
CH2Cl2-soluble (6.7 g) residues. Among them, the
n-hexane extract showed the strongest inhibition
of the movement of C. elegans at a MIC value of
300 µg/ml when compared with MICs of 1200 µg/
ml and > 1200 µg/ml for the CH2Cl2 and H2O ex-
tracts, respectively. Therefore, the n-hexane ex-

tract (75 g) was subjected to silica gel CC (750 g,
63Ð200 µm) by elution with a step gradient of n-
hexane/acetone (100:1, 75:1, 75:1, 50:1, 10:1, 0:100
v/v, each 16 l) to give six pooled fractions (1Ð6),
respectively. Among the six fractions, fraction 1
exhibited the strongest inhibition at a MIC of
38 µg/ml while the other five fractions all showed
inhibition with MICs of > 150 µg/ml. Next, a por-
tion of fraction 1 (2 g) was further fractionated by
silica gel CC (130 g, 63Ð200 µm) to afford four fur-
fraction 1Ð1 (50 mg, n-hexane/
ther fractions,
CH2Cl2 2.6:1 v/v, 2 l), fraction 1Ð2 (500 mg, n-he-
xane/CH2Cl2 2.2:1 v/v, 3 l), fraction 1Ð3 (1.0 g, n-
hexane/CH2Cl2 1:1 v/v, 3 l), and fraction 1Ð4
(235 mg, n-hexane/EtOAc 95:5 v/v, 2 l).

1H and 13C NMR analyses of fraction 1Ð2 indi-
cated that it was a mixture of triglycerides. A por-
tion of fraction 1Ð2 (100 mg) was sequentially
treated with 6 ml of 5% KOH in MeOH for 15 h
and 10 ml of 1 n HCl for neutralization, and then
partitioned with CHCl3/H2O 1:1 v/v (3 ¥ 25 ml) to
give a hydrolysate (60 mg). A portion of the dried
hydrolysate (3 mg) was further treated with an ex-
cess of diazomethane in a diethyl ether solution
prepared using the Diazald“ Kit diazomethane
generator (Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 min to obtain a
product, which was analyzed by GC-EI-MS to
evaluate the fatty acid composition in the triglyc-
eride mixture (Fig. 3D).

In turn, fractionation of fraction 1Ð4 (230 mg)
by MPLC (acetonitrile/H2O 60:40 v/v, 2.5 ml/min,
15 ml/vial, 4 l) sequentially resulted in the isola-
tion of capric acid (2, 60 mg, vials 5Ð12), lauric
acid (3, 116 mg, vials 20Ð30), myristic acid (4,
10 mg, vials 49Ð64), and linoleic acid (6, 15 mg,
vials 70Ð100).

Capric acid (2): Wax, m.p. 29Ð31 ∞C. Ð 1H
NMR, 13C NMR, and GC-EI-MS data (Table I)
were identical to those of the commercial standard
and the reported values (Pouchert and Behnke,
1993).

Lauric acid (3): Wax, m.p. 45Ð47 ∞C. Ð 1H
NMR, 13C NMR, and GC-EI-MS data (Table I)
were identical to those of the commercial standard
and the reported values (Pouchert and Behnke,
1993).

Myristic acid (4): Wax, m.p. 53Ð55 ∞C. Ð 1H
NMR, 13C NMR, and GC-EI-MS data (Table I)
were identical to those of the commercial standard
and the reported values (Pouchert and Behnke,
1993).

Identification of components of fraction 1 by
GC-MS and chemical transformation methods
A 2 µl aliquot of fraction 1 at 10 mg/ml

in
CH2Cl2 was injected into the capillary column and
a representative gas chromatogram is shown in
Fig. 2A. Compounds 1Ð5 in fraction 1 were iden-
tified by comparison of their GC-MS data (Ta-
ble I) with their individual commercial standards
(1 µg for each standard, Fig. 2B). Furthermore, the
identification of 1Ð5 in fraction 1 was confirmed
by the observed homogenous GC when fraction 1
was mixed with their
standards
(Fig. 2C).

individual

In order to identify the overlapping GC peaks
of fraction 1 around 21 min (Fig. 2A) and confirm
the identification of 1Ð5, fraction 1 (10 mg) was
treated with an excess of diazomethane in an ethyl
ether solution for 5 min to afford a product, which
was analyzed by GC-EI-MS (Fig. 3A). Individual
commercial standards 1Ð8 were also treated with
CH2N2 to afford 1aÐ8a, which were analyzed by
GC-EI-MS (Fig. 3B). In addition, the identifica-
tion of 1aÐ8a in the methyl esters of fraction 1
was also confirmed by the observed homogeneous
GC when the methyl esters of fraction 1 were
mixed with 1aÐ8a prepared from their individual
commercial standards 1Ð8 (Fig. 3C).

Nematicidal assay against Caenorhabditis elegans
A mixed population of larval and adult C. eleg-
ans (L1ÐL4 larvae and adults; size range from
~ 0.1Ð1.0 mm), grown on agar plates with feeder
layers of Escherichia coli, was prepared as de-
scribed by Wood (1988). For assays, the worms
were transferred into liquid medium with E. coli
to provide nutrients and stimulate worm motility.
Test materials were assayed at concentrations
ranging from 600 µg/ml (crude extracts) down to
9.4 µg/ml (pure compounds), with 2 ¥ dilutions be-
tween steps (600, 300, 150, etc.). Test materials
were solubilized in DMSO/methanol (1:1) and
added to individual wells of a 96-well polystyrene
microtiter plate (DMSO/methanol also added to
control wells). Methanol was allowed to evapo-
rate, and finally 100Ð200 worms in liquid medium
were added to each well (final DMSO content of
1%). At 4 and 24 h of incubation at 20 ∞C, motili-
ties of the worms in each test well were assessed
under a microscope.

Results and Discussion

Bioassay-guided fractionation of the n-hexane
extract of the seeds of J. chilensis led to the isola-
tion of four known fatty acids including capric acid
(2), lauric acid (3), myristic acid (4), linoleic acid
(6, Fig. 1) along with a mixture of triglycerides for
the first time as described in Materials and Meth-
ods. Compounds 2Ð4, and 6 were identified by

Verification of the origin of 1aÐ8a in fraction 1

In order to verify the origin of the correspond-
ing methyl esters (1aÐ8a) of 1Ð8 in fraction 1
(Fig. 2A), n-hexane instead of MeOH was used to
extract the plant material. In summary, the milled
and dried seeds (2 g) of J. chilensis were sonicated
in 30 ml of HPLC n-hexane at 30 ∞C for 60 min.
After cooling, the mixture was filtered through
Whatman (Clifton, New Jersey, USA) No. 1 filter
paper into a 250 ml round bottom flask. The marc
was extracted two more times in the same man-
ner. The combined extractions were evaporated
in vacuo to afford an oil (280 mg). Duplicate sam-
ple solutions in n-hexane (12 mg/ml) were pre-
pared for GC-EI-MS analysis. A 2 µl aliquot of the
n-hexane extract was injected into the capillary
column and a representative gas chromatogram is
shown in Fig. 2D.

comparison of their physical and spectroscopic
data (m.p., 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and GC-EI-MS)
with those of authentic samples or values reported
in the literature. In turn, the mixture of triglycer-
ides was obtained as a colorless oil and identified
by its characteristic NMR data [δH = 4.16 dd (2H,
J = 6.0 and 12 Hz), 4.31 dd (2H, J = 4.3 and 12 Hz),
5.29 m (1H); δC = 173.22 (s), 172.80 (s), 68.85 (d),
62.09 (t)] (Jie and Lam, 1995). In addition, the
original triglyceride mixture was hydrolyzed with
KOH, and further neutralized by the addition of
HCl; the resulting mixture of fatty acids was me-
thylated with an excess of CH2N2 in diethyl ether.
Table I shows the GC-EI-MS data for the fatty

acid methyl esters of the triglycerides. The relative
compositions of the fatty acids of the triglycerides
were estimated to be octanoic (1, 3.9%), capric
(2, 15.6%), lauric (3, 100%), myristic (4, 20.0%),
palmitic (5, 12.5%), linoleic (6, 4.5%), oleic (7,
21.3%), and stearic (8, 4.5%) acids if an identical
GC response factor was considered for all of their
individual methyl esters (1aÐ8a).

In order to identify the minor components of
fraction 1, its GC-EI-MS data were obtained and
are shown in Fig. 2A and Table I. Two additional
fatty acids (1 and 5) in fraction 1 were sequentially
identified as octanoic acid and palmitic acid by
comparison of their GC-EI-MS data with their in-

Table I. GC-EI-MS data of 1Ð8 and their corresponding methyl esters 1aÐ8a identified from Jubaea chilensis.

dividual commercial standards (Fig. 2B). The iden-
tities of 1Ð5 in fraction 1 (Fig. 2A) were further
confirmed by the observed homogenous gas chro-
matograms after fraction 1 was mixed with their
individual commercial standards (Fig. 2C). In ad-
dition, the overlapping GC peaks around 21 min
(Fig. 2A) were identified as linoleic (6), oleic (7),
and stearic (8) acids by comparison of the GC-EI-
MS data of
fraction 1
(Fig. 3A) with those of 6aÐ8a prepared from the
individual standards (Fig. 3B) and the observation
of their homogenous gas chromatograms (Fig. 3C).
Furthermore, all the EI-MS data of 1Ð8 and 1aÐ
8a were confirmed by a mass spectral library (Na-
tional Institute of Standard and Technology, Wash-
ington DC, USA). In turn, the corresponding
methyl esters (1aÐ8a) of 1Ð8 were also identified
from fraction 1 (Fig. 2A) by using the above men-
tioned techniques. In order to verify the origin of
1aÐ8a, an n-hexane extract was prepared for GC-

EI-MS analysis (Fig. 2D). The absence of 1aÐ8a
in Fig. 2D indicated that compounds 1aÐ8a in
fraction 1 were artifacts generated during the ex-
traction and isolation procedures.

All of the 17 compounds (1Ð8, 1aÐ8a, and a
mixture of triglycerides) were evaluated for their
nematicidal activities against C. elegans, as de-
scribed in Materials and Methods. At 150 µg/ml,
lauric acid (3) and myristic acid (4) were the only
purified compounds
showing activity. Further
characterization of 3 and 4 showed them to be
fully active (100% of worms immobile) at concen-
trations down to 75 µg/ml. Partial activity (reduced
movement) was seen at 38 µg/ml. Fraction 1 was
also fully active at 75 µg/ml, and sometimes at con-
centrations as low as 38 µg/ml (2 of 3 assays). Al-
though compound 3 constitutes almost 50% of
fraction 1 (Fig. 2A), the activity of fraction 1 may
be somehow enhanced by other components in
the mixture.

standards 1Ð8; (C) mixture of methyl esters of fraction 1 and 1aÐ8a; and (D) fatty acid methyl esters obtained from
the triglycerides of J. chilensis.

There were some qualitative differences in the
activities of compounds 3 and 4. The active con-
centrations of both compounds rendered 100% of
the worms immobile at times as early as 1 h, and
this was sustained through at least 4 h (standard
time for first observation). At the 24 h observa-
tion, worms treated with compound 3 remained
completely immobile. Worms treated with com-
pound 4 showed recovery at 24 h, varying from
only a few worms to as high as 100% (indistin-
guishable from controls). In one further experi-
ment with a commercial preparation of lauric acid
(Sigma-Aldrich product number L-4250), worms
initially rendered 100% inactive by a 75 µg/ml
dose showed partial recovery by 24 h (~ 50% of
worms with slow movement). Although the mech-
anism for recovery was not determined, degrada-
tion of the fatty acids by C. elegans or E. coli pre-
sent in the assays is an obvious possibility.

The crude extract of J. chilensis was assayed in
a nematode-infected rodent model at 2,200 mg/kg
of animal weight and was found to be inactive.
