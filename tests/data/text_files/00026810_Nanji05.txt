Summary

Caenorhabditis elegans

The  DAF-2  insulin/insulin-like  growth  factor  1  (IGF-1)
receptor signals via a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)
pathway  to  control  dauer  larva  formation  and  adult
longevity in 
. Yet epistasis analysis
suggests  signal  bifurcation  downstream  of  DAF-2.  We
have used epistasis analysis to test whether the Ras path-
way  (which  plays  a  role  in  signaling  from  mammalian
insulin receptors) acts downstream of DAF-2. We find that
an activated Ras mutation, 
, weakly sup-
presses constitutive dauer diapause in 
 (PI3K)
mutants.  Moreover,  increased  Ras  pathway  signaling
partially  suppresses  the 
  mutant  feeding  defect,
while  reduced  Ras  pathway  signaling  enhances  it.  By
contrast, activated Ras extends the longevity induced by
mutation of daf-2, while reduced Ras pathway signaling
partially suppresses it. Thus, Ras pathway signaling appears
to act with insulin/IGF-1 signaling during larval develop-
ment, but against it during aging.
Key  words: aging; 
signaling; let-60/Ras.

Caenorhabditis elegans

Aging in 
 is controlled by an insulin/IGF-1
signaling (IIS) pathway (Kenyon, 2005). The insulin/IGF-1 recep-
tor is encoded by the gene

et al
of which can more than double adult lifespan (Kenyon 
.,
1993).  In 
,  IIS  also  regulates  formation  of  dauers,
which are long-lived, stress-resistant, diapausal third-stage larvae.
This  dispersal  stage  normally  forms  in  response  to  increased
population  density  and  reduced  nutrition  (Riddle  &  Albert,
1997). Severe mutational reduction of 
 function results in
constitutive formation of dauer larvae (the Daf-c phenotype).

DAF-2 acts via a signal transduction pathway which includes
the AGE-1 PI 3-kinase (Morris 
., 1996), and the AKT-1,
AKT-2 and SGK-1 protein kinase B proteins (Paradis & Ruvkun,
1998; Hertweck 
., 2004). These protein kinases inactivate
the  FOXO  transcription  factor  DAF-16  by  phosphorylation.
Mutation of 
 suppresses all mutant phenotypes result-
ing from mutation of 
. PTEN phosphatases attenuate IIS
by dephosphorylating phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate
(PIP3). 
 DAF-18 PTEN phosphatase is a negative regu-
lator of signaling via DAF-2 and AGE-1 (Ogg & Ruvkun, 1998;
et al
Gil 
., 1999).
Epistasis  analysis  of  insulin/IGF-1  signaling  has  been  com-
plicated by the fact that different 
 mutant alleles interact
in different ways with mutations in other genes. For example,
mutation of 
, which encodes a nuclear hormone receptor

  Daf-c.  Yet  when
added to 
 it has an enhancing effect, resulting in
early larval arrest (Vowels & Thomas, 1992; Larsen

Such  allele-specific  interactions  reflect  the  existence  of  dis-
tinct classes of 
 allele. Class 1 mutants are Daf-c and Age;
class 2 mutants exhibit these traits plus several others, including
early larval arrest, reduced feeding (Eat) and production of pro-
geny  late  in  life  (Gems 
.,  1998).  Class  1  mutations  occur
exclusively in the portion of the 
 gene encoding the extra-
cellular domain of the receptor, while class 2 mutations occur
et al
in  both  intracellular  and  extracellular  domains  (Kimura 
.,
1997) (D. Patel and D. Gems, in preparation). Although weaker
alleles are largely class 1, in terms of Daf-c and Age some class
daf-2
1 alleles are more severe than most class 2 alleles. Thus, 
alleles do not fall into a single allelic series. This suggests that
the 
 gene contains several functional domains, which are
differentially  impaired  in  different  mutants.  This  could  reflect
multiple  signaling  outputs  from  the  DAF-2  receptor  (Gems
et al

., 1998).

The occurrence of signal bifurcation from DAF-2 is supported
by  other 
  epistasis  studies.  For  example,  in  severe
age-1
 mutants, Daf-c is largely suppressed by gain-of-function
mutations in 
 and 
, and a weak reduction-of-function
mutation in 
 (Fig. 1). If PI 3-kinase were the sole signaling
output  of  DAF-2,  then  the  same  mutations  should  suppress
Daf-c  in  the  weak 
  mutant.  In  fact,  they  do  not

Fig. 1 Insulin/IGF-1 signaling in C. elegans and 
mammals. In C. elegans epistasis analysis suggests 
the presence of other pathways signaling 
downstream of DAF-2. Comparison with the 
mammalian insulin and IGF-1 signaling pathways 
suggests the Ras pathway as a candidate for such 
a pathway. There are other possible interactions 
between the insulin/IGF-1 receptor and Ras, for 
example via the docking protein Shc. A working 
hypothesis in this study is that DAF-2 signals via the 
Ras pathway as well as the PIP3 pathway. Note that 
IST-1 is the C. elegans orthologue of IRS.

Notably, the C-terminal region of the

  acts  as  a
switch in biological signaling, where Ras-GTP is the ‘on’ state
and  Ras-GDP  the  ‘off’  state.  The  PI  3-kinase  pathway  is  the
major signaling output of the insulin and IGF-1 receptors, while
et al
signaling through Ras plays a lesser role (Medema 
., 1993;
et al
Yonezawa 
., 1997; Leahy 
., 2004).
C. elegans
 DAF-2 pro-
tein contains predicted binding motifs not only for the regula-
tory subunit of PI 3-kinase, but also for SEM-5 (Grb2) (Kimura
et al
., 1997), which could be utilized to activate Ras. In the Ras
pathway, the Grb2 adaptor protein binds via its SH2 domain to
phosphotyrosyl  residues  in  activated  insulin  receptor  substrates
(Fig. 1). The guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Sos (son-
of-sevenless) binds to the SH3 domains of Grb2, thus bringing
it (Sos) to the plasma membrane. Sos activates Ras by catalysing
the exchange of GDP for GTP. Activated Ras binds to and acti-
vates the Raf serine/threonine kinase, which phosphoactivates
the  kinase  MEK,  which  in  turn  phosphoactivates  MAP  kinase
(ERK).  The  latter  then  phosphorylates  multiple  transcription
factors. Depending on context, this can result in metabolic, differ-
entiative or mitogenic responses (Schlessinger, 2000).

The Ras signaling pathway acts downstream of a number of
receptor tyrosine kinases, including the EGF and PDGF receptors
(White & Kahn, 1994; Adams 
., 2000; Schlessinger, 2000).
Insulin signaling via Ras can also lead to inhibition of the fork-
head transcription factor FOXO4 (AFX) (Kops 
., 1999). How-
ever, in this context, Ras acts via Ral, a related small GTPase, by

means of activation of RalGEF, and not MAP kinase (Wolthuis
& Bos, 1999; Essers 
., 2004). Several sites of cross-talk between
the Ras pathway and IIS have also been reported. For example,
Ras can directly interact with and stimulate PI 3-kinase (Kodaki
et al
., 2001),
and  PKB  can  phosphorylate  and  thereby  inhibit  Raf  (Rommel
et al

The  weak  reduction-of-function  mutation 
suppresses  Daf-c  in 
,  but  not  the  weak  class  2  allele
daf-2(e1370) (Gottlieb & Ruvkun, 1994; Larsen et al., 1995; Gil
et al.,  1999).  We  found  that  both  class  1  daf-2  alleles  tested
were fully suppressed by daf-18(e1375) (Table 1). By contrast,
there  was  little  suppression  of  class  2  daf-2  alleles:  daf-18(rf)
only weakly suppressed daf-2(e1370) at 72 h (25 °C), although
by 96 h almost all dauers had recovered, consistent with pre-
vious findings. Moreover, daf-18(rf) did not suppress the em-
bryonic and L1 arrest trait of daf-2(e979).

In terms of Daf-c, daf-2(e1369) is a more severe allele than
e1370 or e979: at 15 °C these mutants form 55, 0 and 20%
of dauers, respectively (Gems et al., 1998). Yet daf-18(rf) fully
suppresses  only  e1369  Daf-c  (this  study).  Because  DAF-18
removes PIP3, the unusual severity of the Daf-c phenotype in
daf-2(e1369) may reflect reduced PI 3-kinase signaling. How-
ever, we also found that all four daf-2 alleles were fully sup-
pressed by the null mutation daf-18(nr2037) (25 °C; data not

shown).  Possibly,  modulation  of  daf-2  mutant  phenotypes  by
signaling  other  than  PIP3  is  only  detectable  against  a  back-
ground of reduced PIP3 levels.

Gain-of-function  alleles  of  pdk-1  and  akt-1  are  efficient
suppressors of Daf-c in age-1(0) but not daf-2(e1370) (Paradis
& Ruvkun, 1998; Paradis et al., 1999). In contrast to daf-18(rf),
we  find  that  pdk-1(gf)  and  akt-1(gf)  are  poor  suppressors  of
Daf-c in class 1 daf-2 mutants (Table 1). Yet both pdk-1(gf) and
akt-1(gf) caused some degree of suppression of the embryonic
and L1 arrest trait of daf-2(e979), which daf-18(rf) did not.

daf-18(rf), pdk-1(gf) and akt-1(gf) suppress Eat and 
late progeny production in daf-2 mutants

pdk-1(gf) and akt-1(gf) are better suppressors than daf-18(rf) of
daf-2 embryonic and L1 arrest – which are class 2-specific phenotypes.
Is this true of all class 2-specific mutant defects? Our evidence
suggests not. We examined effects of daf-18(rf), pdk-1(gf) and
akt-1(gf) on reduced feeding (Eat) and production of late progeny
in daf-2(e1370) adults (Larsen et al., 1995; Gems et al., 1998). To
examine the Eat trait, animals were shifted from 20 °C to 25 °C
at the fourth larval stage (L4), and pharyngeal pumping rates meas-
ured over a 5-day period. N2, pdk-1(gf), akt-1(gf), daf-18(rf) and
daf-2(m577) strains showed a similar small decline in pumping
rate over this period (data not shown). By contrast, pumping rate in
daf-2(e1370) fell dramatically, as expected. daf-18(rf), pdk-1(gf) and
akt-1(gf) all partially suppressed the daf-2 Eat trait (Fig. 2A).

mutations which reduce let-60/Ras signaling are not dauer con-
stitutive, we expected that this pathway would play at most a
modulatory  role  in  the  control  of  dauer  formation  by  IIS.  We
found that the activated Ras mutation let-60(n1046gf) weakly
suppressed daf-2 Daf-c in class 1 but not class 2 mutants (Table 2).
let-60(gf)  caused  the  majority  of  dauer  larvae  formed  by  daf-
2(m577) (25 °C) and daf-2(e1369) (22.5 °C) to recover by 120 h.
This is consistent with action of LET-60/Ras in a second path-
way downstream of DAF-2. This could signal in parallel to the
AGE-1  catalytic  subunit  of  PI  3-kinase  (Morris  et al.,  1996)
(Fig. 1),  in  which  case  let-60(gf)  should  suppress  the  mutant
effects of loss of function of age-1. Alternatively, the effects of
let-60(gf) could be mediated through activation of AGE-1 via
the Ras-interacting domain, as can occur in mammals (Kodaki
et al., 1994; Rodriguez-Viciana et al., 1997; Sheng et al., 2001).
C. elegans  AGE-1  does  contain  a  predicted  Ras-interacting
domain  (Morris  et al.,  1996).  We  found  that  let-60(gf)  can
weakly  suppress  age-1(mg44),  a  putative  null  allele  (Morris
et al.,  1996).  At  22.5 °C,  75%  of  age-1(0); let-60(gf)  larvae
exited dauer by 96 h (Table 2). Thus, the weak influence of Ras
signaling  on  IIS-associated  dauer  formation  does  not  require
AGE-1 PI 3-kinase.

during the first 5 days of adulthood. (A) Suppression of the daf-2(e1370) Eat 
phenotype by pdk-1(gf), akt-1(gf) and daf-18(e1375). On days 2–5, the rate 
of pumping in all daf-2(e1370) double mutants was significantly higher than 
in the daf-2(e1370) single mutant [two-tailed Mann–Whitney test, P < 0.0001 
except for daf-2(e1370); akt-1(mg144gf) where P < 0.002; n = 21–37 at all 
genotype/time points]. (B) Reduction-of-function mutations affecting Ras 
signaling significantly reduce pharyngeal pumping in daf-2(m577) (class 1) 
mutants on days 2–4 (two-tailed Mann–Whitney test, P < 0.0001 days 2 and 
3; P < 0.015 day 4; n = 16–37 at all genotype/time points). (C) Weak 
suppression of the daf-2(e1370) Eat phenotype by gain-of-function mutations 
affecting the Ras pathway. Pumping rates were significantly higher relative 
to daf-2(e1370) on days 2 and 3 for daf-2(e1370); let-60(n1046gf) and 
daf-2(e1370); sos-1(pd10gf) [two-tailed Mann–Whitney test, P < 0.05; 
n = 16–37 at all genotype/time points except for daf-2(e1370); sos-1(pd10gf) 
on day 5 where n = 7].

Similarly, daf-18(rf), pdk-1(gf) and akt-1(gf) all suppressed late
progeny production by daf-2(e1370) (data not shown).

reduction-of-function  alleles  of  let-60,  and  two  other  Ras
pathway genes, sem-5 (Grb2/Drk) and sos-1 (GEF). In these
genes, loss of function results in early larval (L1) lethality (Han
et al., 1990; Clark et al., 1992; Chang et al., 2000). Therefore, we
used  weak  reduction-of-function  alleles,  testing  for  effects
on  Daf-c  in  daf-2(m577)  (class  1)  and  daf-2(e1370)  (class  2).
sem-5  weakly  enhanced  the  Daf-c  phenotype  of  daf-
2(m577),  doubling  the  proportion  of  dauer  larvae  formed
(Table 3). This is consistent with signaling from DAF-2 to SEM-
5. Unexpectedly, in daf-2; let-60 animals, Daf-c was masked by
increased levels of L1 arrest; a low level of L1 arrest was also
seen  in  daf-2; sem-5  populations  (Table 3).  In  daf-2; sos-1
animals, no enhancement of Daf-c or L1 arrest was seen (data
not shown).

Ras signaling influences the daf-2 feeding defect

Does  Ras  pathway  signaling  play  a  role  in  other  daf-2
mutant  traits,  such  as  reduced  feeding  (Eat)  and  production
of late progeny? To address this, we tested whether reduced
Ras signaling would induce these class 2-specific traits in a
class  1  daf-2  mutant  (m577),  and  whether  increased  Ras
signaling would suppress them in a class 2 mutant (e1370).
To  reduce  Ras  signaling,  we  used  sem-5(n1779),  sos-1(n1613)
and let-60(n2021); to increase it, we used sos-1(pd10gf) and let-
60(n1046gf).

Ras  pathway  single  mutants  pumped  at  a  similar  rate  to
N2 and daf-2(m577) animals (data not shown). However, in
daf-2(m577); sem-5(rf),  daf-2(m577); sos-1(rf)  and  daf-
2(m577);  let-60(rf)  animals,  the  pumping  rate  was  reduced
(Fig. 2B). Moreover, there was a small but significant increase
in pumping rate in daf-2(e1370); sos-1(gf) and daf-2(e1370);
let-60(gf)  animals  relative  to  the  daf-2(e1370)  single  mutant
(Fig. 2C).

By  contrast,  altered  Ras  signaling  had  little  effect  on  late
progeny  production.  let-60(gf)  did  not  suppress  late  progeny
production by daf-2(e1370), nor did sem-5(rf) and let-60(rf)
cause daf-2(m577) animals to produce late offspring (data not
shown).  However,  4/55  daf-2(m577); sos-1(rf)  animals  did
produce late offspring, while daf-2(m577) and sos-1(rf) single
mutants did not (n = 71 and 16, respectively).

Ras signaling increases lifespan when insulin/IGF-1 
signaling is reduced

Next  we  examined  the  effect  of  Ras  signaling  on  the  daf-2
increased lifespan (Age) phenotype. let-60(gf) by itself caused
a considerable reduction in lifespan (Fig. 3, Table 4). The effect
of let-60(gf) on daf-2 mutants was complex: in three of the four
daf-2  mutants  tested,  it  increased  maximum  lifespan  but  not
mean lifespan. The form of the survival curves suggests a bimo-
dal distribution of population mortality. In each daf-2; let-60(gf)
cohort there is a sharp increase in mortality early in life (parti-
cularly in week 2). This is followed by a drop in mortality, leaving
a longer-lived population subset which outlive the daf-2 cohorts
in 3/4 cases. The let-60(gf) mutation is highly pleiotropic and
its  various  phenotypic  effects  show  variable  penetrance.  We
suggest that this leads to early death in a subset of the popu-
lation,  probably  from  causes  unrelated  to  normal  C. elegans
aging. In those that escape premature death, let-60(gf) appears
to enhance the daf-2 Age phenotype.

To confirm this, we censored the deaths that occurred during
the  first  2 weeks  of  adulthood,  and  then  compared  mortality
in  daf-2  and  daf-2; let-60(gf)  populations.  The  effects  of  let-
60(gf)  on  daf-2  mean  lifespan  in  the  long-lived  subset  were:
m577,  +2.3%,  P = 0.78  (log  rank  test);  e1370,  +67.6%,
P = 0.0002; e1369, +30.2%, P = 0.0004; and e979, +43.8%,
P < 0.0001. This implies that LET-60 Ras contributes to the
daf-2 mutant Age phenotype.

If this conclusion is correct, reduction of Ras pathway sign-
aling should suppress the daf-2 Age phenotype. We therefore
tested effects of sem-5(n1779), sos-1(n1613) and let-60(n2021)
on lifespan, alone or in combination with daf-2(m577) (Fig. 2,
Table 4). None of the Ras pathway mutations alone extended
lifespan; let-60(rf) and sem-5(rf) each slightly reduced lifespan
in one of the two trials (P < 0.05). However, all three Ras path-
way  mutations  partially  suppressed  the  daf-2  Age  phenotype
(P < 0.0001 in all cases) (Fig. 3, Table 4). This implies that wild-
type  activity  of  these  genes  contributes  to  the  daf-2  Age
phenotype. Taken together, these findings point strongly to the
unexpected conclusion that Ras pathway signaling acts with IIS
during larval development, but in opposition to it during aging.

L1 arrest in daf-2 and let-60 mutants entails different 
mechanisms

Severe mutations in either daf-2 or let-60 can result in L1 arrest,
yet  this  is  unlikely  to  involve  the  same  mechanism.  let-60(0)
mutants die at the L1 stage with a fluid-filled morphology (Han
et al., 1990). We find that this is distinct from the daf-2(e979)
L1  arrest.  e979 L1  larvae  appeared  morphologically  normal
under Nomarski microscopy and most had arrested at the four-
cell gonad stage, similar to L1s hatching in the absence of food
(5/5 N2 animals hatched in the absence of food and 15/16 L1-
arrested e979 animals with food present arrested at the four-
cell gonad stage). In e979 L1s, pharyngeal pumping was weak

the multivulva phenotype is suppressed by daf-2(e1370) (Battu
et al., 2003).

daf-2(rf) enhances let-60(rf) L1 lethality, but does not 
suppress let-60(gf) excretory duct cell duplication

daf-2(rf) in Ras pathway mutants results in an increased level
of L1 arrest (Table 4). But is this due to an increase in the daf-2
L1 arrest trait or in the let-60 L1 arrest? We find that it is the
latter. let-60(0) is lethal due to failure of excretory duct cell fate
specification – hence the fluid-filled morphology. All daf-2; sem-
5(n1779) and daf-2; let-60(n2021) arrested animals were fluid
filled.  This  implies  that  IIS  influences  Ras  pathway  function
during the specification of the excretory duct cell fate.

To test this further, we investigated whether mutation of daf-
2  suppresses  the  effects  of  let-60(gf)  on  excretory  duct  cell
development. Around half of let-60(gf) animals show duplica-
tion  of  the  duct  cell  nucleus  (Yochem  et al.,  1997),  and  we
observed this too. However, mutation of daf-2 (four alleles, as
above)  did  not  affect  this  duplication  (data  not  shown).  By
contrast, a previous study did show that reduced insulin/IGF-1
signaling can suppress a mutant trait generated by let-60(gf):

Discussion

Classical  genetic  studies  imply  that  signal  bifurcation  might
occur downstream of the DAF-2 receptor. Mammalian receptor
investigations suggest that this might involve the Ras pathway.
In this study, we explored two possibilities: first, that the LET-
60 Ras pathway plays a role in DAF-2 signaling; and second that
differences in LET-60 Ras and PI 3-kinase signaling contribute
to the difference between class 1 and class 2 daf-2 alleles. Over-
all, our findings provide clear support for the first idea, and some
evidence for the second.

Evidence that Ras signalling acts downstream of DAF-2

Several findings are consistent with action of LET-60 Ras down-
stream of DAF-2: (1) let-60(gf) weakly suppresses constitutive
dauer  formation  (Daf-c)  in  daf-2  mutants;  (2)  let-60(gf)  sup-
presses the embryonic and early larval arrest trait of daf-2(e979);
(3) sem-5(rf) enhances daf-2 Daf-c; and (4) lowered Ras pathway

signaling  enhances  the  daf-2  Eat  trait,  while  increased  Ras
pathway signaling weakly suppresses it.

embryonic and early larval arrest, reduced feeding rate (Eat) and
late progeny production.

Given  that  daf-2  signaling  acts  via  the  DAF-16  FOXO  tran-
scription factor, these effects of Ras signaling might be exerted
via DAF-16. daf-2(+) inhibits DAF-16 activity, triggering its phos-
phorylation and cytoplasmic retention (Henderson & Johnson,
2001; Lee et al., 2001; Lin et al., 2001). We looked for effects
of let-60(gf) and let-60(rf) on DAF-16 cellular localization in daf-
2(+)  and  daf-2(m577)  backgrounds,  but  saw  none  (data  not
shown). Thus, if LET-60/Ras has any influence on DAF-16 func-
tion, it is not exerted via major changes in distribution of DAF-
16. Consistent with this, in mammals Ras-RalGEF-Ral-induced
phosphorylation  of  FOXO4  influences  transcription  without
affecting nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution (De Ruiter et al., 2001).

Can daf-2 allele classes be explained by signal 
bifurcation?

Our initial working hypothesis was that class 1 and class 2 daf-
2 mutants are characterized by greater loss of PI 3-kinase and
Ras signaling, respectively. We tested this by examination of
several daf-2 mutant traits: Daf-c, which is seen in all daf-2
alleles,  and  several  traits  which  only  occur  in  class  2  alleles:

Daf-c
The weak reduction-of-function allele daf-18(e1375) suppresses
the Daf-c phenotype of class 1 daf-2 mutants but not class 2
mutants.  In  this,  class  1  mutants  resemble  severe  age-1
mutants, which are defective in PI 3-kinase signaling alone. This
is consistent with a greater reduction in PIP3 synthesis in class 1
mutants. However, both class 1 and class 2 daf-2 mutants were
fully suppressed by daf-18(0). We therefore postulate that alter-
native pathway modulation of daf-2 mutant phenotypes is only
detectable against a background of reduced PIP3 levels.

Embryonic and early larval arrest
This class 2-specific trait is seen at a low level in several daf-2
alleles  (e.g.  e1370),  and  at  a  high  level  in  e979  (Gems  et al.,
1998). e979 early arrest was largely suppressed by  let-60(gf),
but  unaffected  by  daf-18(e1375).  This  suggests  that  reduced
LET-60 Ras signaling contributes to this trait. However, the fail-
ure of daf-18(rf) to suppress in this instance must also reflect
the severity of the reduction of PI 3-kinase activity, because
daf-18(0) fully suppresses daf-2(e979).

Eat and late progeny production
Class  2  mutants  show  a  temperature-sensitive  feeding  defect
(Eat)  (Gems  et al.,  1998).  We  found  that  this  is  partially
suppressed not only by let-60(gf) and sos-1(gf), but also by
daf-18(rf). Late progeny production (also class 2 specific) was
also  suppressed  by  daf-18(rf).  Thus,  these  two  traits  do  not
appear to be attributable to selective loss of PI 3-kinase or LET-
60 Ras signaling.

Previously,  daf-2  allele  class  differences  were  described  in
terms of a formal model in which a bifunctional daf-2 gene
contains  elements  daf-2A  and  daf-2B.  According  to  this
scheme,  class  1  alleles  are  daf-2A(–)daf-2B(+)  while  class  2
alleles are daf-2A(–)daf-2B(–) (Gems et al., 1998). In terms
of  this  scheme,  the  results  of  this  study  suggest  a  possible
correspondence between daf-2A and PI 3-kinase signaling. The
suppression of the embryonic and early larval arrest traits of daf-
2(e979) by let-60(gf) but not daf-18(e1375) suggest a possible
correspondence  between  daf-2B  and  LET-60  Ras  signaling.
However, other findings presented here fail to support such a
correspondence. It seems likely that the properties of daf-2 may
be fully explained only by signal transduction via other insulin-
associated signaling moieties, such as IST-1 (IRS) (Wolkow et al.,
2002), SGK-1 (Hertweck et al., 2004), LET-363/CeTOR and DAF-
15/raptor (Jia et al., 2004), candidate Shc proteins (Luzi et al.,
2000), or C. elegans orthologs of Ral-GEF and Ral (Wolthuis &
Bos, 1999).

Ras signaling contributes to longevity assurance

Our results show that Ras signaling can promote longevity. let-
60(gf)  enhances  the  daf-2  longevity  (Age)  phenotype,  while
reduction of Ras signaling partially suppresses it (Fig. 3, Table 4).
As in dauer formation, Ras signaling does not influence longev-
ity  where  DAF-2  activity  is  high  and  DAF-16  low,  but  it  can
where DAF-2 activity is low and DAF-16 high. However, while
LET-60/Ras potentiates DAF-2 signaling in the control of dauer
formation, early larval development and feeding, it acts antag-
onistically to it in longevity assurance.

The effects of Ras signaling on aging in C. elegans were un-
expected. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, many
studies have shown that Ras activity shortens lifespan, whether
replicative  or  chronological  (Longo,  2004).  Moreover,  in  both
yeast  and  mammalian  cells,  Ras  stimulates  production  of
mitochondrial oxidants, which in human cells promote cellular
senescence (Lee et al., 1999; Hlavata et al., 2003). Possibly,
in C. elegans, Ras signalling reduces longevity where IIS is high,
but extends it where IIS is low.

In conclusion, our results demonstrate that Ras pathway sig-
naling influences a number of traits regulated by IIS, including
embryogenesis, dauer larva formation and aging. There is also
a reciprocal effect of IIS on some Ras pathway-regulated traits:
excretion/viability  in  L1s  (this  study)  and  vulval  development
(Battu et al., 2003). We postulate that DAF-2 receptor signaling
via  SEM-5/Grb-2  to  LET-60/Ras  contributes  to  IIS-regulated
phenotypes. Moreover, differences in relative levels of disruption

of LET-60 Ras and PI 3-kinase might contribute to daf-2 allele
class differences.

(mg142gf); MT4185 sem-5(n1779). The N2 used was the CGC
male stock; there is variation among N2 lines, and this line best
approximates wild type (Gems & Riddle, 2000).

Construction of multiple mutant strains

daf-2(ts); daf-18 strains were constructed as follows: daf-18(e1375)
males were crossed with daf-2 hermaphrodites at 15 °C, and
F1  progeny  selfed  at  25 °C  (22.5 °C  for  e979).  Homozygous
daf-2 segregants were picked as constitutive dauer larvae. Sup-
pression by daf-18 was not expected, because daf-18 mutations
are maternally rescued (Gil et al., 1999). However, a small proportion
of  dauers  maintained  at  25 °C  (22.5 °C  for  e979)  resumed
development after several days, and some of the resulting adults
exhibited the exploding vulva characteristic of daf-18 homozygotes.
After strain characterization, the presence of daf-18(e1375) in
the  daf-2(e979); daf-18(e1375)  strain  was  reconfirmed  by
checking for the occurrence of the daf-18 exploding vulva trait.
The  presence  of  the  m577  and  e1369  alleles  in  the  double
mutants  was  also  confirmed  by  crossing  with  wild  type  (N2),
selfing the F1 at 25 °C, and checking for the presence of con-
stitutive dauer larvae among the F2. In the case of e1369, these
dauers were allowed to recover and self at 15 °C; some dauer larvae
were  observed,  consistent  with  the  allele  being  e1369  [most
daf-2(ts) alleles do not form dauer larvae at this temperature].
daf-2; akt-1(mg144)  and  daf-2; pdk-1(mg142)  strains  were
constructed as follows: akt-1 or pdk-1 males were mated with
daf-2 hermaphrodites at 15 °C, and F1 heterozygotes selfed at
25 °C (22.5 °C for e979). Homozygous daf-2 segregants were
picked as constitutive dauer larvae, and potential akt-1 or pdk-
1  double  mutants  identified  as  dauers  that  recovered  after
several days. After propagation, each putative double mutant
was selfed again at 25 °C (22.5 °C for e979), and in each case,
all dauer larvae eventually recovered. Given that the single daf-2
mutant  dauer  larvae  do  not  recover  under  these  conditions,
it  was  inferred  that  (a)  the  recovering  dauer  larvae  were
homozygous for akt-1 or pdk-1, and (b) that neither suppressor
mutation  causes  significant  dominant  suppression  of  daf-2.
After  strain  characterization,  the  presence  of  e979  in  the

daf-2(e979); pdk-1(gf) was confirmed by back-crossing to wild
type and resegregation of the ts embryonic lethal/L1 arrest trait.
Construction  of  all  double  mutants  containing  daf-2  and
mutations  in  the  Ras  pathway  began  with  the  same  steps.
daf-2 males were crossed with Ras pathway mutant hermaph-
rodites, then F1 hermaphrodites were selfed at 25 °C, and F2
dauer  larvae  picked  and  allowed  to  recover.  In  the  case  of
daf-2; let-60(n1046gf), recovering dauers exhibiting the multi-
vulva (Muv) trait were picked and selfed, and checked for the
presence of a high proportion of Muv progeny to ensure that
they were homozygous (because n1046 is semi-dominant). In
the case of daf-2; let-60(n2021rf), F2 dauers were allowed to
recover and self at 15 °C, and double mutants lines identified
as vulvaless (Vul) animals, a proportion of whose progeny died
as  L1s  with  a  rod-like  appearance.  In  the  case  of  daf-2;
sem-5(n1779),  recovering  dauers  were  selfed  at  22.5 °C  and
checked for production of more dauers than the daf-2 single
mutant  (which  forms  few  dauers  at  this  temperature).  The
presence of the n1779 mutation was then confirmed by PCR
amplification of the region of the gene containing the lesion,
and by sequencing. In the case of daf-2; sos-1(n1613), recovering
dauers were selfed at 15 °C, allowed to lay some progeny and
then  transferred  to  25 °C.  Double  mutant  progeny  produced
all arrested L1s at the higher temperature. In the case of double
mutants where the Daf-c phenotype was masked by the L1 Let
phenotype,  the  presence  of  the  daf-2  mutation  was  re-
confirmed by crossing with wild type and checking the L2 for
segregation of dauer larvae at 25 °C.

daf-2; sos-1(pd10gf)  strains  were  constructed  as  follows.
daf-2  males  were  crossed  with  sos-1(pd10gf)  unc-46(e177)
hermaphrodites  and  non-Unc  cross  progeny  placed  at  25 °C.
Dauers  were  picked  and  allowed  to  recover  at  15 °C.  From
these, unc-46 hermaphrodites were selected and mated with sos-
1(pd10gf) males. Again, non-Unc cross progeny were placed at
25 °C and dauers selected. Upon recovery at 15 °C, non-Uncs
were  cloned  and  a  line  of  non-segregating  Uncs  was  picked.
sos-1(pd10gf) was isolated in an independent study as a suppressor
of sem-5(n1619) lethality (A. Wooller and N.A.H., in preparation).
The  strain  age-1(mg44)/mnC1  [dpy-10(e128)  unc-52(e444)]
II; let-60(gf) IV was constructed as follows. age-1/mnC1 males
were crossed with let-60(gf) hermaphrodites, and then F1 males
and hermaphrodites mated. Strongly Muv non-Dpy non-Unc F2
hermaphrodites  were  then  placed  individually  on  plates  and
allowed to self, and plates segregating Dpy Uncs (i.e. where the
F2 hermaphrodite was heterozygous for mnC1) were retained.
From these plates, a number of hermaphrodites were tested to
see  whether  they  were  homozygous  for  mg44,  by  selfing  at
25 °C  and  looking  for  segregation  of  100%  dauers  (mg44
homozygotes would not be expected to form dauer larvae in
the F3 due to maternal rescue).

Dauer formation and early larval arrest assays
Test  strains  were  raised  at  15 °C,  and  then  approximately
half  a  dozen  gravid  hermaphrodites  were  transferred  to  a

© Blackwell Publishing Ltd/Anatomical Society of Great Britain and Ireland 2005

fresh plate at the test temperature, and allowed to lay eggs
for  3–5 h,  after  which  they  were  removed.  Each  plate  was
examined daily to follow development to a terminal phenotype.
Any adults or L4 larvae were counted and removed. The num-
bers of dauer larvae and other arrested progeny were scored
approximately 72 h after the midpoint of egg-laying at 25 °C,
80 h at 22.5 °C and 96 h at 21 °C. In some cases dauer recovery
was also scored at a later time point (see data tables). Samples
compromised  by  fungal  or  bacterial  contaminants  were
excluded.

Pharyngeal pumping and late progeny assays
Animals were raised at 20 °C, and shifted to 25 °C as L4s (day
0).  Pumping  was  scored  in  the  presence  of  food  for  15 s  for
each animal. Typically, 25–30 animals were assayed per geno-
type  per  day,  using  a  stereomicroscope.  Typically,  a  small
number of animals were not pumping in each assay. This pro-
portion generally increased as the experiment progressed. The
pumping rate of the remaining animals also fell as the experi-
ment progressed. As the pumping rates of populations did not
fit a normal distribution, statistical analysis was performed using
a two-tailed Mann–Whitney test.

To  measure  late  progeny  production,  animals  raised  at
20 °C  were  picked  as  L4s  and  placed  at  25 °C  and  moved
to  fresh  plates  every  day.  After  9 days  of  adulthood  animals
were placed on individual plates and maintained at 25 °C. Late
progeny were defined as those appearing after day 9 of adult-
hood. N2 hermaphrodites ceased laying eggs between days 4
and 5.

Lifespan measurements

These  were  conducted  as  previously  described  (Gems  et al.,
1998). let-60(rf) results in a partially penetrant Vul phenotype,
which  results  in  death  from  internal  hatching  of  larvae.  To
prevent this, animals were maintained on 5-fluorodeoxyuridine
(FUdR),  which  inhibits  DNA  replication  (Gandhi  et al.,  1980).
Survival  analyses  were  performed  using  the  Kaplan  Meier
method on censored data, and the significance of differences
between survival curves calculated using the log rank test. The
statistical software used was JMP v.5.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary,
NC, USA).
