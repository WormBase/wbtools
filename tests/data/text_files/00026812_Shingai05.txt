Abstract

Lysine and chloride ions are water-soluble attractants for Caenorhabditis elegans. When chemotaxis behavior to either of these
attractants was assayed separately, the radial concentration gradients of 3 M lysine and 0.1 M ammonium chloride had similar potencies
for attracting worms. However, when the concentration gradients of lysine and ammonium chloride at
these concentrations were
presented simultaneously, worms preferred lysine to ammonium chloride more than expected from the results obtained in separate
experiments, suggesting the presence of an interaction between these two sensory information pathways within the nervous system.
Chemotaxis behavior toward the radial concentration gradient of one of these attractants superimposed on a uniform concentration of the
other attractant showed that the chemotaxis was augmented or attenuated by the ammonium chloride background depending on the
background concentration, and attenuated by the lysine background, further supporting the interaction between the two sensory
information pathways.

1. Introduction

The presentation of two sensory stimuli

to animals
should induce an informational interaction in the nervous
system between neuronal responses to the two inputs.
Studies on the structurally relatively simple nervous system
of invertebrates have provided insights into this informa-
tional interaction (Chase et al., 1978; Fredman and Jahan-
Parwar, 1980; Thomas et al., 1980; Wedemeyer and Schild,
1995). In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, sensory
informational interactions were suggested through experi-
ments using chemoattractants and repellents such as diacetyl
and copper ions (Ishihara et al., 2002) or diacetyl and
sodium acetate (Matsuura et al., 2004) as two sensory
stimuli, and determining behavioral outputs. In both cases,

an inhibitory or excitatory sensory interaction was consid-
ered to exist in their nervous system.

C. elegans can sense a number of chemoattractants and
repellents through the function of
their sensory organ
called the amphid. The amphid consists of 12 classes of
sensory neurons, and the roles of these sensory neurons in
chemotaxis behavior have been extensively studied (Ward,
1973; Dusenbery, 1974; Bargmann and Mori, 1997). For
example, AWA neurons are responsible for detecting the
odorant diacetyl
(Bargmann et al., 1993). ASE, ADF,
ASG and ASI neurons are responsible for detecting the
water-soluble sodium and chloride ions, and ASE, ASH
and ADL neurons are responsible for detecting copper
ions (Bargmann and Horvits, 1991; Sambongi et al.,
1999). The chemotaxis behavior of worms
to the
simultaneous presentation of two attractants, diacetyl and
sodium acetate (Matsuura et al., 2004), shows that
the
sensory informational
interactions may occur between
signal pathways in the nervous system from the two
distinct subsets of chemosensory neurons. A question

the interaction between signaling
arises as to whether
pathways from other subsets of chemosensory neurons
exists.

l-lysine is detected primarily by ASK and ASE neurons
and secondarily by ASG and ASI neurons. On the other
hand, chloride ions are detected primarily by ASE neurons
and secondarily by ADF, ASG and ASI neurons (Barg-
mann and Horvits, 1991)
(Fig. 1). ASE neurons are
composed of ASER and ASEL, and chloride ions are
sensed mainly by ASER and slightly by ASEL (Pierce-
Shimomura et al., 2001). Therefore, ASE, ASG, and ASI
neurons have overlapping functions for detecting both l-
lysine and chloride ions, while ASK and ADF neurons have
selective sensitivity for either of these attractants. The
outputs from these neurons accumulate in interneurons.
Here, we describe the quantitative analysis of the chemo-
taxis behavior of C. elegans in response to the simultaneous
presentation of radial concentration gradients of two water-
soluble chemoattractants, l-lysine and ammonium chloride.
We have also studied the chemotaxis behavior of worms
toward the radial concentration gradient of the attractant
formed in the presence of a uniform concentration of the
other attractant.

Fig. 1. Schematic diagram of neural network of interaction of sensory
information on lysine and chloride ions. The number of synapses and gap
junctions were obtained from the database (Oshio et al., 2003) based on
White et al. (1986). The arrows show chemical synapses: wide arrows
indicate the number of synapses n R 20, thick arrows 10o n < 20, and thin
arrows 1o n < 10. Gap junctions, whose number of connections between a
pair of neurons is more than three, exist only between ASI and AIA, and a
dashed line shows them. The sensory neurons and the interneurons are
depicted by triangles and hexagons, respectively. Chemotaxis behavior
toward lysine is primarily triggered by ASE and ASK neurons, while that
toward chloride ions by ASE neurons. Whole information is integrated in
AIA and AIB interneurons, the outputs are sent to other interneurons to
modulate the movement of the worm. Several interneurons are depicted to
show the information pathway via synapses, although interneurons were not
studied in this research.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Animals

Wild-type (Bristol N2) Caenorhabditis elegans was
obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center at the
University of Minnesota. The nematodes were grown and
maintained on NGM (nematode growth medium) agar plates
(3 g/L NaCl, 2.5 g/L polypeptone, 5 mg/L cholesterol, 1
mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgSO4, 25 mM KH2PO4, pH 6.0, and 17
g/L agar) seeded with the Escherichia coli OP50 strain at 20
-
C (Brenner, 1974). In all chemotaxis assays, we used
young adult hermaphrodites. To obtain synchronously
staged young adult hermaphrodites, about ten gravid worms
were transferred to a fresh seeded medium, allowing the
worms to lay eggs for 2 h, then removed from the plate
(Ishihara et al., 2002). The egg-containing plate was
incubated at 20
C. We used the worms when the clear
crescent structure around the vulva disappeared (approx-
imately 70 – 80 h after removal of gravid worms).

2.2. Chemotaxis assays

2.2.1. Assay plate

Nine-centimeter-diameter tissue culture dishes containing
10 mL of 1.5% agarose (1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgSO4, 5 mM
KH2PO4 (pH 6.0, adjusted with KOH), and 15 g/L agarose)
were used for the assay. The radial concentration gradient of
lysine or ammonium chloride was established in assay
plates by placing the attractant
twice (Ward, 1973), as
described below.

2.2.2. Single-spot presentation

For chemotaxis assays for lysine, l-lysine (WAKO; pH
6.0 adjusted with acetic acid) of various concentrations
between 0.01 and 3 M were used. Lysine (10 AL) was
placed twice on the surface of an assay plate (the center of
region A, Exp. 1 in Fig. 2) 24¨27 h and 5 h before the
-
C
start of the assay, and the assay plate was kept at 20
until use. The times of lysine spotting were determined to
obtain the maximal chemotaxis index by scanning the
spotting time between 20 and 30 h for the first spotting
and between 3 and 6 h for the second. The chemotaxis
assay for ammonium chloride was carried out using NH4Cl
(pH 6.0 adjusted with 28% ammonia solution) of various
concentrations between 0.03 M and 3 M. Ammonium
chloride (7 AL) as an attractant was placed twice on the
surface of an assay plate (the center of region B, Exp. 2 in
Fig. 2) 15¨18 h and 3 h before the start of the assay to
obtain a concentration gradient, and the assay plate was
kept at 20
C until use. The times of ammonium chloride
spotting were the same as those for sodium acetate
chemotaxis (Matsuura et al., 2004). To anaesthetize the
animals, 1 AL of 0.1 M sodium azide was spotted at the
centers of regions A and B shortly before the chemotaxis
assay.

the bottom of the tube using a micropipette (3 AL) to the
center of the two regions of C and D (Fig. 2). Excess
solution around the worms was removed, and the clumped
animals were separated from each other by gently
touching them with a Kimwipe. When the number of
animals in C or D was greater than 20, some of them
were gently removed using a platinum wire (0.1 mm in
diameter). The total number of animals in both regions
was approximately 30 at the start of the assay. The worms
were allowed to move freely on the assay plate for 90
min. The numbers of animals in each of the regions, A,
B, C and D (circles of 2 cm diameter) and E, which is an
area outside A, B, C and D, were determined under a
dissecting microscope (OLYMPUS SZ40) every 10 min.
At least eight assays were performed for all concentrations
of each attractant. All experiments were performed during
daytime at 20

C.

2.3. Scoring and analysis

The chemotaxis index was calculated based on the
the attractant
number of animals in the region of
(Bargmann et al., 1993). We calculated the chemotaxis
index (CI(t)) and the fraction of animals (FR(t)) at time t
(min) after the start of the assay using the following
formulas:

enclosed by circles of 2 cm diameter. Worms were placed at the center of C
and D equidistant (2.8 cm) from the test and control locations at the start of
the assay. E is the area outside A, B, C and D. Five types of experiments
(Exps. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) were performed as shown in the lower part.

were obtained by superposition of worms’ images for 60 min at 10-s
intervals.

2.2.3. Two-spot presentation

In the experiment on the radial concentration gradients of
both attractants presented simultaneously,
lysine, ammo-
nium chloride and sodium azide were placed on an assay
plate using the same process as that
in the single-spot
presentation (Exp. 3 in Fig. 2).

2.2.4. Single-spot-on-background presentation

In the experiments on the radial concentration gradients
of an attractant superimposed on a uniform concentration
background of another or the same attractant, various
amounts of 2 M lysine or 3 M ammonium chloride solution
were added to the melted 1.5% agarose solution described
above, immediately before pouring the solution onto plastic
dishes. The radial concentration gradient of the attractant
was established on an assay plate using the same process as
that in the single-spot presentation (Exp. 4 and Exp. 5 in
Fig. 2).

2.2.5. Worms

2.4. Visualization of path of locomotion

Worms were collected from the culture plate using a
buffer solution (1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgSO4, 5 mM
KH2PO4 and 0.05% Tween20; pH 6.0 adjusted with
KOH) and transferred into 15-mL conical centrifuge
tubes. The tubes were centrifuged for 20 s at 60 g,
and the supernatant was discarded. The collected animals
were washed with the buffer solution three times prior to
use. Approximately 15 animals were then transferred from

To analyze tracks made by the animals during a chemo-
taxis behavior, the images of the assay plate were recorded
and digitized in a computer through a lens and a CCD
camera for 60 min at 10-s intervals. The images of the
worms were extracted using a software program (Image-Pro
Plus). The path of locomotion was obtained by superposing
the images of the worms.

2.5. Ion concentration in assay plate

in the same way as that of the case of the single-spot
presentation of ammonium chloride.

Chloride ion concentration on the surface of the assay
plate in the single-spot presentation was determined with a
potentiometer
(HM-30S, TOA Co.) by measuring the
potential difference between a chloride-selective electrode
(7024L, DKK Co., Tokyo, Japan) and a reference electrode
(HS-505DP, TOA Co., Tokyo, Japan). The electrodes were
placed in contact with the agarose surface. The measured
potential was converted to chloride ion concentration with a
calibration curve. Ammonium chloride at 0.5 M (7 AL) was
placed twice as described in Section 2.2, and the measure-
ments were taken at 17 points on the agarose plate at the
start of assay. The chloride ion concentrations at these points
depended almost only on the distance from the position
where the attractant was placed. A theoretical curve of the
concentration – distance relationship of
the chloride ion
C(t,r) was calculated with the following equations (Pierce-
Shimomura et al., 1999). The second equation was based on
the theory of diffusion in 2-dimensional media (Crank,
1975).

0.08 for

lysine and 0.91

In the first series of experiments, lysine or ammonium
chloride was placed singly at the center of A or B (Fig. 2A).
Fig. 2B and C show the trajectories of the worms moving
toward the lysine and ammonium chloride regions, respec-
tively. These chemicals at their respective concentrations
obviously attracted the worms. The average CI(t) of lysine
(Fig. 3A) and ammonium chloride (Fig. 3B) increased with
time. The initial increase in CI(t) was faster and the CI(90),
which was the final value of each measurement, increased
with the concentration of the attractant. Maximum values of
CI(90)s of 0.55
0.02 for
ammonium chloride were obtained at the highest concen-
tration used (Fig. 3C, D; 3M). There was no significant
difference among CI(t)s and FR(t)s for the 0.03 M point
source of lysine, the 0.01 M point source of ammonium
chloride, and distilled water (Fig. 3C; 0 M), indicating that
the lowest concentrations at which the worms were attracted
were between the 0.03 M and 0.1 M point source of lysine
and between the 0.01 M and 0.03 M point source of
ammonium chloride in our experimental system. The
FR(90) in region E of 0.01 M ammonium chloride was
different from that of distilled water (Fig. 3E). We took
CI(20) as a characteristic CI(t) in the initial increasing phase
because CI(t) was in the increasing phase at 20 min at most
concentrations. The dependences of CI(20) and CI(90) on
the attractant concentration differed (Fig. 3C and D), and
thus CI(20) as well as CI(90) were compared under different
experimental conditions.

We determined the concentrations of the attractants that
showed similar CI(90)s in order to use this result in the
following section. The CI(20) and CI(90) for 3 M lysine
and those for 0.1 M ammonium chloride were not
significantly different, respectively. Also, the CI(20)s for
3 M lysine and 0.3 M ammonium chloride did not differ
significantly (Fig. 3A – D).

3.2. Simultaneous presentation of concentration gradients
of two attractants (two-spot presentation)

To study the effects of the simultaneous presentation of
the two attractants at different locations on the behavior of
C. elegans, a second series of experiments was conducted.
Because the CI(t)s for 3 M lysine and 0.1 M ammonium
chloride in the single-spot presentation did not differ
significantly, it was conceivable that the two-spot presenta-
tion (Fig. 2A, Section 2.2) of these attractants at
these
concentrations gave statistically indifferent FR(t)s for both

attractants. However,
the worms were preferentially
attracted to 3 M lysine (Fig. 4A). This result suggests the
presence of an interaction between the sensory information
stimulated by lysine and by ammonium chloride. In the
following, we refer to this as ‘‘balanced’’ chemotaxis when
the chemotaxis toward both attractants shows statistically
indifferent FR(t)s, and ‘‘unbalanced’’ chemotaxis when it
does not. To determine the concentrations at which chemo-
taxis behavior is balanced for the two attractants, we fixed
the ammonium chloride concentration at 0.1 M and varied
the lysine concentration from 0.01 M to 3 M. As the lysine
concentration was increased, CI(90) increased (Fig. 4B) and
FR(90) for ammonium chloride decreased (Fig. 4D, left

panel). Similarly, lysine at 3 M (fixed) and ammonium
chloride at various concentrations were presented in the
two-spot presentation. As the ammonium chloride concen-
tration was increased in the range between 0.1 M and 3 M,
CI(20) and CI(90) decreased (Fig. 4C), and FR(90) in the
lysine region decreased (Fig. 4D,
right panel). Taken
together, chemotaxis behavior
toward these attractants
suppressed each of them.

In the two-spot presentation experiments, chemotaxis
behavior toward the two attractants was balanced when we
used 0.3 M lysine and 0.1 M ammonium chloride (CI(20)),
1 M lysine and 0.1 M ammonium chloride (CI(90)), and 3
M lysine and 0.3 M ammonium chloride (CI(20) and

comparisons between the single-spot and two-spot presen-
tations for lysine and ammonium chloride at concentrations
that showed similar CI(t)s in the single-spot presentation.
Balanced chemotaxis behavior cannot be explained by a
simple subtraction of
the results from the single-spot
presentation, except by the results of CI(20) for 3 M lysine
and 0.3 M ammonium chloride, and CI(90) for 1 M lysine
and 0.1 M ammonium chloride. There is a consistent
tendency that
lysine in
comparison to that of ammonium chloride became stronger

than that in the 0.1 M ammonium chloride region in the two-
spot presentation. This relationship was opposite that in the
single-spot presentation. Similarly, FR(20) and FR(90) in
the 1 M lysine region and FR(20) and FR(90) in the 0.3 M
ammonium chloride region were not different, respectively,
in the two-spot presentation; however, in the single-spot
presentation, CI(20) and CI(90)

lysine and ammonium chloride,

results may be that the suppression of ammonium chloride
chemotaxis by lysine is stronger than the suppression of
lysine chemotaxis by ammonium chloride.

In the second series of experiments, there were several
other features observed of worm chemotaxis behavior.
When the concentration of lysine was high (3 M) and that
of ammonium chloride was relatively low (0.03 M or 0.1
M),
the worms behaved as if there was no ammonium
chloride at all (i.e., the CI(t)s were almost the same as those
in the single-spot presentation) (Fig. 4A, C, D), despite the
fact
that 0.03 M and 0.1 M ammonium chloride could
induce substantial chemotaxis (Fig. 3). Although not
completely the same as above, similar trends were observed
when we used 3 M lysine and 3 M ammonium chloride, or 3
M lysine and 1 M ammonium chloride (Fig. 4C). We
observed a strongly biased chemotaxis toward ammonium
chloride at these concentrations, which was not expected
from the single-spot presentation.

3.3. Chemotaxis to concentration gradient of attractant on
background of another attractant uniformly distributed
(single-spot-on-background presentation)

There are two possible explanations for the unbalanced
chemotaxis in the two-spot presentation. The spatial
concentration gradients of
the two attractants may be
requisite for the interaction between signals from the two
attractants in the two-spot presentation. Alternatively, the
existence of an attractant on the assay plate itself, but not its
gradient, may directly inhibit the chemotaxis to the other
attractant. To determine the latter effect, a third series of
assays was performed in which a single attractant was
placed in A or B on a uniform background of the other
attractant.

We measured the concentration of ammonium chloride
using a chloride-ion-selective electrode as described by
Pierce-Shimomura et al. (1999), and estimated the lysine
concentration on the surface of the assay plate in the single-
spot presentation. Fig. 5A (>) shows the measured chloride
ion concentrations at the start of chemotaxis assay on the
surface of the assay plate on which 0.5 M ammonium
chloride was spotted, and it also shows the theoretically
derived curve as described in Section 2.5. The measured

measured at the start of assay. Abscissa indicates the distance between the
electrode and the center of B where ammonium chloride was placed. The
dotted line indicates 2 mM which is the concentration of chloride ions
included in the plain assay plate (as 1 mM CaCl2). The chloride ion
concentration in single-spot-on-background presentation (N) is also shown.
0.5 M ammonium chloride was spotted twice on 0.03 M lysine background.
There was no significant difference between the chloride ion concentrations
in the absence (>) and the presence (N) of 0.03 M lysine background. Both
sets of data with (2 plates) and without (2 plates) lysine background were
obtained in the same experiment. The thick curve indicates the theoretically
estimated concentration of ammonium chloride in single-spot presentation
without lysine background as described in Section 2.5. (B) Theoretically
estimated concentrations of attractants, when 3 M lysine is placed at center

under the assumption described in Section 2.5. Ammonium chloride
concentration (thick curve) is obtained by a simple reduction in the size of
the curve (the measured values for 0.5 M ammonium chloride spot were
divided by 5) shown in (A). The thin dotted line indicates 2 mM.

chloride ion concentration depended solely on the distance
of the position of the electrode from the center of region B
where ammonium chloride was spotted. Fig. 5B shows the
theoretically estimated concentrations of lysine and chloride
ions where the 3 M lysine or 0.1 M ammonium chloride was
placed. The estimated concentrations of these attractants 2.8
cm apart from the center of A or B (corresponding to the
start position C and D) are about 0.002 M (Fig 5B).
Therefore, we used the background concentration ranging
from 0.003 M to 0.1 M in the next series of single-spot-on-
background experiments. We also measured the chloride ion
concentration on the surface of the assay plate on which 0.5
M ammonium chloride was spotted on the 0.03 M lysine
background (Fig. 5A). There was no significant difference
between the chloride ion concentration on the 0.03 M lysine
background (N) and that without lysine background (>) at
the same position of the assay plate. Since the estimated
lysine concentration is lower than about 0.03 M at any place
of the assay plate (Fig. 5B),
the chloride concentration
gradient
in the two-spot presentation was probably not
affected by the presence of lysine. Similarly, the presence
of low concentration of chloride ions probably did not
affect
in the two-spot
presentation.

To determine whether the presence of lysine or ammo-
nium chloride, but not its concentration gradient, affected
the unbalanced chemotaxis in the two-spot presentation, the
attractant was added uniformly in the assay plate. Ammo-
nium chloride at 0.1 M was spotted on a uniform
background of lysine at various concentrations, and chemo-
taxis was assayed (Fig. 6A, filled bar). The CI(90) for 0.1 M
ammonium chloride spotted with the 0.003 – 0.03 M lysine
background was almost
the
background and decreased by R 0.05 M lysine background
in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, when 3 M lysine
was spotted on an ammonium chloride background, the
CI(90) was biphasic depending on the background concen-
tration. The 0.003 – 0.01 M and 0.05 M background did not
influence lysine chemotaxis, while the 0.03 M background
augmented and R 0.07 M background suppressed the
chemotaxis (Fig. 6A, open bar). At
the relatively low
concentrations of background attractant, the worms could
discriminate the point source of either attractant from the
other attractant uniformly distributed. However,
the dis-
criminatory power was lost
(i.e., CI(90) significantly
decreased) by the presence of the R 0.05 M lysine back-
ground and by the presence of the R 0.07 M of ammonium
chloride background. As a control experiment, we examined
the chemotaxis to an attractant on the uniform background
of the same attractant (Fig. 6B). Both CI(90)s for 3 M lysine
and 0.1 M ammonium chloride decreased significantly in
the presence of the R 0.03 M background. Comparing the
case in which the focally applied and background attractants
were different with the case in which they were the same
substance, the suppression of chemotaxis (i.e. attenuation of
recognition to the attractant concentration gradient) by the

different attractant in the background was weaker than the
suppression by the same attractant in the background. Also,
the 0.05 – 0.07 M lysine background suppressed both
chemotaxis for ammonium chloride and that for lysine. In
contrast, the effect of the 0.03 – 0.07 M ammonium chloride
background was biphasic to the chemotaxis for lysine as

to suppress
chemotaxis toward 0.1 M ammonium chloride in the two-
spot presentation assay. For a similar reason,
the direct
potentiation or suppression of lysine chemotaxis by a
uniform background of ammonium chloride is not appro-
priate to explain the unbalanced chemotaxis in the two-spot
presentation assay. Therefore, the contribution of the direct
suppression of ammonium chloride chemotaxis by lysine or
the direct potentiation of lysine chemotaxis by ammonium
chloride in the unbalanced chemotaxis may be small. There
may be other mechanisms, including the effect of attractant
gradient, for realizing the unbalanced chemotaxis in two-
spot presentation assay.

Although, these results may not explain the unbalanced
chemotaxis,
the results obtained by the single-spot-on-
background presentation assay clearly indicate a certain
form of interactions between sensory inputs from lysine and
ammonium chloride. In this aspect, the difference should be
noted between the inhibitory effect of lysine background on
ammonium chloride chemotaxis and the inhibitory or
augmentatory effect of ammonium chloride background on
lysine chemotaxis in the single-spot-on-background presen-
tation. Furthermore, CI(90)s were almost the same with or
without a low concentration of the background attractant,
that is, the worms behave as if there is no background
attractant at all.

4. Discussion

The simultaneous presentation of multiple attractants
and/or repellents detected by distinct subsets of sensory
neurons revealed the interaction of sensory information
within the C. elegans nervous system (Ishihara et al., 2002;
Matsuura et al., 2004). In this study, we examined the effect
of the simultaneous presentation of two attractants detected
by partially overlapping subsets of sensory neurons and
showed behavioral features indicating a sensory informa-
tional interaction.

In the two-spot presentation of lysine and ammonium
chloride, chemotaxis for 0.1 M ammonium chloride
decreased with an increasing concentration of the point
source of lysine in a dose-dependent manner. Similar results
were obtained by the reciprocal combination of these
attractants. These phenomena can be interpreted to indicate
that the signaling pathways for these attractants suppress
each other. Quite different from the interaction between
diacetyl and copper ions (Ishihara et al., 2002) and from
diacetyl and sodium acetate signalings (Matsuura et al.,
2004),
the interaction between lysine and ammonium
chloride signaling could occur in single or multiple sensory
neurons having overlapping functions. ASE, ASG and ASI

neurons contribute to chemotaxis for both lysine and
ammonium chloride (Bargmann and Horvits, 1991). A
simple explanation for the unbalanced chemotaxis behavior
in the two-spot presentation, which could not be explained
simply by results from the single-spot presentation, may be
that the lysine-background stimulates ASE, ASG and ASI
neurons, and this attenuates the sensitivity of these neurons to
chloride ions. If this were the case, the sensitivity of the ASE
neuron, the primary sensory neuron for ammonium chloride,
would be attenuated in the simultaneous presentation, while
the ASK neuron, the primary sensory neuron for lysine,
would remain intact under the same conditions. This could
partially explain the preferential chemotaxis toward lysine
over that expected from the single-spot presentation. Another
possibility also remains that the presence of chloride ions
produces an augmentation to chemotaxis to lysine, which
shifts slightly the balance of chemotaxis in the two-spot
presentation, although only a small augmentation is observed
at a limited background concentration (Fig. 6B). The sensory
informational
interaction could also occur in the neural
network located downstream of these sensory neurons.

AWC neurons in C. elegans sense different volatile
attractants such as benzaldehyde and butanone (Bargmann
et al., 1993). In the presence of a high uniform concentration
of one of these volatile attractants, C. elegans cannot be
attracted by the chemical (self-saturation) but retains its
ability to approach other volatile attractants sensed by AWC
(the absence of cross-saturation) (Bargmann et al., 1993;
L’Etoile and Bargmann, 2000). The situation is slightly
different between the water-soluble attractants lysine and
ammonium chloride, which are sensed by overlapping
subsets of sensory neurons. In our single-spot-on-back-
ground presentation, the worms can discriminate either of
the two water-soluble attractants in the presence of a low
uniform concentration of the other attractants, but in the
presence of a high uniform concentration of either of these
attractants, the worms no longer approached the concen-
tration gradient of the other attractant. The cross-saturation-
like suppression of lysine (or ammonium chloride) chemo-
taxis by ammonium chloride (or lysine) suggested the
presence of an informational
interaction between the
signaling pathways for lysine and ammonium chloride.
Alternatively, this can be interpreted as the C. elegans not
being able to discriminate these two chemicals, suggesting
that these chemicals are sensed in the same neuron(s), in
high concentrations (Pierce-Shimomura et al., 2001).
Furthermore, the suppression of chemotaxis to one attractant
by another attractant could be interpreted by cross-adapta-
tion (Colbert and Bargmann, 1995; Atkinson-Leadbeater et
al., 2004) in the same sensory neuron(s).

Since the single-spot-on-background presentation experi-
ments indicated that the contribution of the attractant itself is
relatively small, the concentration gradient of these attrac-
tants may play an important role in the unbalanced chemo-
taxis in the two-spot presentation. Previous studies of worm
chemotaxis demonstrated that a temporal decrease in

R. Shingai et al. / Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology, Part A 142 (2005) 308 – 317

317

attractant concentration induces an increase in frequency of
backward movements (Dusenbery, 1980; Pierce-Shimomura
et al., 1999). Similarly, the temporal increase and/or decrease
in ambient temperature regulates the frequency of backward
movement and Ca2+ influx in thermosensory AFD neurons
(Ryu and Samuel, 2000; Zariwala et al., 2003; Kimura et al.,
2004). The sensory neurons of C. elegans might be tuned to
respond to the gradient of sensory cues. In this context, in the
two-spot presentation, approaching the chloride location
means leaving the lysine location, that is, a temporal increase
in the concentration of either of the attractants means a
temporal decrease in the concentration of the other attractant.
Recently, we and others have revealed the contribution of
amphid sensory neurons and interneurons to the regulation of
backward locomotion, as well as to chemotaxis behavior
(Tsalik and Hobert, 2003; Wakabayashi et al., 2004). It is of
interest to determine how the worms regulate their locomo-
tion in response to the concentration gradients of these
attractants to achieve an unbalanced chemotaxis in the two-
spot presentation experiments.

In unbalanced chemotaxis in the two-spot presentation,
the worms tend to ignore the low attractant concentration
despite the fact that the attractant can induce substantial
chemotaxis at this low concentration range in the single-spot
presentation. We think that this is important for the worms
because the biased chemotaxis toward a stronger attractant
may be more beneficial to the worms by allowing them to
choose more favorable conditions by disregarding the less
favorable conditions, similar to those described by L’Etoile
and Bargmann (2000).
