The evolutionarily conserved p38 mitogen-activated pro-
tein kinase (MAPK) cascade is an integral part of the
response to a variety of environmental stresses. Here we
show that the Caenorhabditis elegans PMK-1 p38
MAPK pathway regulates the oxidative stress response
via the CNC transcription factor SKN-1. In response to
oxidative stress, PMK-1 phosphorylates SKN-1, leading
to its accumulation in intestine nuclei, where SKN-1
activates transcription of gcs-1, a phase II detoxification
enzyme gene. These results delineate the C. elegans p38
MAPK signaling pathway leading to the nucleus that re-
sponds to oxidative stress.

Oxidative stress contributes to the etiology of various
degenerative diseases such as ischemia and the process
of aging. In vertebrates, a major mechanism of oxidative
stress defense is orchestrated by the two NF-E2-related
factors Nrf1 and Nrf2, which belong to the Cap-N-Collar
(CNC) family of transcription factors (Hayes and McMa-
hon 2001; Motohashi and Yamamoto 2004; Xu et al.
2005). Nrf proteins induce expression of a battery of
phase II detoxification enzymes. Nrf proteins accumu-
late in cell nuclei in response to oxidative stress. In the
nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the SKN-1 protein is
required for oxidative stress resistance (An and Black-
well 2003). SKN-1 is distantly related to the Nrf proteins
and induces phase II detoxification gene transcription.

tinal nuclei. This oxidative stress response thus appears
to be widely conserved.

Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling
pathways serve as transducers of extracellular stimuli
that allow cellular adaptation to changes in the environ-
ment. The p38 MAPKs are an evolutionary conserved
subfamily of MAPKs that play an important role in ad-
aptation, homeostasis, and specialized stress responses.
Studies in vertebrate cell culture systems implicate the
p38 MAPK signaling pathway in the response of cells to
a variety of stresses and inflammatory cytokines at the
cellular level
(Chang and Karin 2001; Kyriakis and
Avruch 2001; Johnson and Lapadat 2002). However,
there has been relatively little research into the role of
the p38 MAPK signaling pathway in stress response in
whole animals. In this study, we have taken a genetic
approach to define the role of the p38 MAPK pathway in
the C. elegans oxidative stress response, as a model sys-
tem for stress-induced signal transduction.

Results and Discussion

The C. elegans p38 MAPK pathway is involved
in the oxidative stress response

Mammalian p38 is activated in response to stress stimuli
(Chang and Karin 2001; Kyriakis and Avruch 2001;
Johnson and Lapadat 2002). Thus, we first investigated
whether oxidative stress activates p38 MAPK in C. el-
egans. Western blot analysis using an anti-phospho p38
antibody that specifically recognizes the phosphorylated,
activated form of p38 MAPK (Kim et al. 2002) revealed
that p38 MAPK was activated by treatment with sodium
arsenite, paraquat, and t-butyl peroxide, with arsenite
being the most potent (Fig. 1A). Animals harboring the
pmk-1 deletion mutation exhibited diminished levels of
PMK-1 protein and arsenite-induced p38 MAPK activa-
tion (Fig. 1B). This indicates that oxidative stress acti-
vates PMK-1 in C. elegans.

We have recently shown that the C. elegans p38 MAPK
is regulated by SEK-1 MAPKK and NSY-1 MAPKKK
(Sagasti et al. 2001; Kim et al. 2002; Tanaka-Hino et
al. 2002). The NSY-1–SEK-1–p38 pathway determines
asymmetric cell fate decision during neuronal develop-
ment (Sagasti et al. 2001; Tanaka-Hino et al. 2002) and
mediates the nematode defense against pathogens (Kim
et al. 2002). UNC-43, a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent pro-
tein kinase II, acts upstream of NSY-1 in the former
pathway (Sagasti et al. 2001) but is not involved in the
innate immunity pathway (Kim et al. 2002). Therefore,
we next asked whether arsenite-induced PMK-1 activa-
tion is mediated by the NSY-1–SEK-1 pathway. Wild-
type, sek-1, and nsy-1 mutant animals were treated with
arsenite and examined for PMK-1 activation. Signifi-
cantly, we found that activation of PMK-1 in response to
arsenite was markedly reduced in sek-1 mutants com-
pared with wild-type animals (Fig. 1B). The sek-1 muta-
tion was also defective in PMK-1 activation by paraquat
and t-butyl peroxide (Fig. 1A). These findings indicate
that SEK-1 MAPKK is an essential upstream activator of
PMK-1 in response to oxidative stress. In contrast, acti-
vation of PMK-1 in response to arsenite was partially
reduced in nsy-1 mutants (Fig. 1B), suggesting that re-
dundant signaling molecules, probably other MAPKKK

p38 MAPK and oxidative stress

The hypersensitivity of sek-1 mutant animals to arse-
nite could be significantly suppressed by reintroduction
of the wild-type sek-1 gene as an extrachromosomal
transgene (Fig. 1D). In C. elegans, oxidative stress regu-
lates gene expression in the intestine (An and Blackwell
2003). To test whether expression of sek-1 in the intes-
tine is sufficient to rescue arsenite hypersensitivity, we
expressed sek-1 under the control of the intestine-spe-
cific ges-1 promoter (Egan et al. 1995). When a plasmid
containing the Pges-1⬋sek-1 transgene was introduced
as an extrachromosomal array into sek-1 mutant ani-
mals, we found that arsenite hypersensitivity was par-
tially rescued (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that SEK-1
function in the intestine is necessary, but not sufficient
for the protection of animals against oxidative stress.

In C. elegans, oxidative stress induces expression in
the intestine of gcs-1, a gene encoding the phase II de-
toxification enzyme, ␥-glutamine cysteine synthase
heavy chain (An and Blackwell 2003). To determine
whether stress-dependent gcs-1 gene activation in the
intestine is mediated by the p38 MAPK pathway, we
generated a strain containing a gcs-1 promoter⬋GFP
(green fluorescent protein) transgene: Pgcs-1⬋gfp (An
and Blackwell 2003). When raised in the absence of ar-
senite, Pgcs-1⬋gfp animals exhibited little GFP expres-
sion in the intestine (Fig. 2A,B). However, intestinal GFP
expression dramatically increased in Pgcs-1⬋gfp animals
following exposure to arsenite. In contrast, in sek-1 and
pmk-1 mutants, the induction of Pgcs-1⬋gfp in intestine
was dramatically lower (Fig. 2A,B). Furthermore, in the
sek-1 background, gcs-1 induction in the intestine in re-
sponse to paraquat and t-butyl peroxide was also im-
paired (Supplementary Fig. S1). These results suggest
that oxidative stress leads to the induction of gcs-1 tran-
scription in the intestine through the activation of the
p38 MAPK signaling cascade.

p38 MAPK pathway regulates the nuclear localization
of SKN-1 in response to oxidative stress
The induction of gcs-1 expression in the intestine in re-
sponse to oxidative stress is mediated by the transcrip-
tion factor SKN-1 (An and Blackwell 2003). This raised
the possibility that SKN-1 may be a downstream target
of the p38 MAPK stress response pathway in C. elegans.
To examine this possibility, we tested SKN-1 as a PMK-1
substrate. We produced a GST–SKN-1 fusion protein in
bacteria and tested its ability to be phosphorylated in
vitro. HEK293 cells were transfected with a mammalian
expression vector encoding an HA-tagged PMK-1. HA-
PMK-1 was then immunoprecipitated from cell lysates
and tested for in vitro phosphorylation of GST–SKN-1.
HA-PMK-1 exhibited a basal kinase activity and failed to
phosphorylate GST–SKN-1 (Fig. 3A, lane 1). Coexpres-
sion of HA-PMK-1 with SEK-1 in HEK293 cells induces
phosphorylation of the coexpressed PMK-1, resulting in
strong activation of PMK-1 (Tanaka-Hino et al. 2002).
When this activated PMK-1 was tested in the in vitro
kinase assay, it was found to efficiently phosphorylate
GST–SKN-1 (Fig. 3A, lane 2). SKN-1 phosphorylation by
PMK-1 required the presence of active PMK-1 in the im-
mune complex, since a kinase-inactive form of PMK-1,
coexpressed with SEK-1, was unable to phosphorylate
the SKN-1 protein (Fig. 3A, lane 3). These results suggest
that SKN-1 functions as a direct target of the PMK-1.
The primary amino acid sequences of SKN-1 contain po-

members, may also participate in the process. Further-
more, the unc-43 loss-of-function mutation was found to
have no effect on arsenite-induced PMK-1 activation
(data not shown). These results suggest that the up-
stream components of SEK-1 that mediate stress-depen-
dent activation of PMK-1 are different from the upstream
components mediating neuronal asymmetric develop-
ment and innate immunity.

We next asked whether the SEK-1–PMK-1 pathway is
in fact important in protecting the nematode against oxi-
dative stress. We found that the sek-1 mutant animals
were hypersensitive to arsenite, whereas the nsy-1 mu-
tants displayed the same sensitivity as wild type to ar-
senite (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, the sek-1 mutant animals
were dramatically sensitive to paraquat and t-butyl per-
oxide (data not shown). Thus, there is a close correlation
between the strength of PMK-1 activation and the sen-
sitivity of the animal to oxidative stress. However,
pmk-1 mutants were partially sensitive to arsenite (Fig.
1C). Although C. elegans has two p38 MAPK orthologs,
pmk-1 and pmk-2 (Berman et al. 2001), RNAi to inhibit
pmk-2 expression did not enhance the arsenite sensitiv-
ity of pmk-1 mutants (data not shown). It is at present
unclear which MAPKs function redundantly with
PMK-1 in the stress response pathway.

tential MAPK phosphorylation sites at Ser-74 and Ser-
340 (Fig. 3B). To determine whether PMK-1 phosphory-
lates SKN-1 at these residues, we tested mutants of
SKN-1 in which either or both residues were substituted
with Ala. The S74A and the S340A mutants were weakly
phosphorylated by PMK-1, while the S74, 340A mutant
was not phosphorylated at all (Fig. 3C). Thus, PMK-1
directly phosphorylates SKN-1 at Ser-74 and Ser-340.

It is known that oxidative stress induces SKN-1 to be
relocalized from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in C. el-
egans (An and Blackwell 2003). We determined whether
arsenite stress could also induce nuclear localization of
SKN-1 in the intestine, using a transgene in which GFP
is fused to the C terminus of full-length SKN-1 (An and
Blackwell 2003).
In larvae and young adults, SKN-
1⬋GFP was usually absent in intestinal nuclei. After ex-
posure to arsenite, elevated levels of SKN-1⬋GFP ap-
peared in intestinal cell nuclei in a high percentage of
animals (Fig. 2C,D). To address whether the nuclear
translocation of SKN-1⬋GFP could be regulated by the
p38 MAPK pathway, we examined the effect of the sek-1
and pmk-1 mutations on the SKN-1 localization. Arse-
nite-induced nuclear accumulation of SKN-1⬋GFP was
drastically decreased in sek-1 and pmk-1 mutants (Fig.
2C,D), indicating that relocalization following arsenite
stress involves the PMK-1 pathway. Nuclear localization
of SKN-1 is regulated through constitutive and stress-
inducible mechanisms in the ASI chemosensory neurons
and intestine, respectively (An and Blackwell 2003). The
sek-1 mutant exhibited no change in the location or the
intensity of SKN-1⬋GFP in the ASI neurons (Supple-
mentary Fig. S2). Thus, the PMK-1 pathway is required

for an inducible response in one tissue but not for con-
stitutive regulation of SKN-1 in a different context.
Taken together, these results suggest that oxidative
stress activates the PMK-1 pathway and promotes
nuclear accumulation of SKN-1 in the intestine, leading
to activation of stress-induced genes such as gcs-1.

We next investigated the role of skn-1 in arsenite re-
sistance in C. elegans. skn-1(zu67) homozygotes produce
normal numbers of offspring with normal timing, and as
young adults, these mutants are not obviously distin-
guishable in morphology from wild type (An and Black-
well 2003). However, the skn-1(zu67) mutant animals
exhibited markedly decreased survival in the presence of
arsenite (Fig. 4A), indicating that the skn-1 gene is re-
quired for resistance to arsenite stress. The hypersensi-
tivity of skn-1 mutant animals to arsenite could be sig-
nificantly rescued by reintroduction of the wild-type
skn-1 gene as an extrachromosomal transgene (Fig. 4A).
To address the biological importance of PMK-1 phos-
phorylation, we introduced into skn-1 mutant animals a
GFP fusion to the skn-1(S74, 340A) mutant. Whereas the
wild-type form of SKN-1 was found predominantly in
the nucleus in animals exposed to arsenite, SKN-1(S74,
340A)⬋GFP was found exclusively in the cytoplasm (Fig.
4B,C). Furthermore, skn-1(zu67) mutant animals bearing
the skn-1(S74, 340A) gene exhibited enhanced sensitiv-
ity to arsenite (Fig. 4A). These results indicate that
SKN-1 phosphorylation on two Ser residues by PMK-1 is
a crucial aspect of skn-1 gene function and a pivotal
point of regulation.

We next asked whether oxidative stress increases the
total protein levels of SKN-1 and whether PMK-1-depen-
dent phosphorylation of SKN-1 is involved in its protein
stability. We analyzed the SKN-1⬋GFP proteins in wild-
type animals carrying the skn-1⬋gfp transgene as an ex-
trachromosomal array by immunoblotting before and af-
ter arsenite treatment. Arsenite treatment increased the
levels of SKN-1⬋GFP proteins (Supplementary Fig. S3).

p38 MAPK and oxidative stress

This arsenite-induced accumulation of SKN-1⬋GFP was
still observed in sek-1 mutants carrying the skn-1⬋gfp
transgene, indicating that the PMK-1 pathway does not
regulate the protein stability of SKN-1.

The nuclear accumulation of SKN-1 in response to ar-
senite stress could be caused by decreased nuclear export
or an increased import. To determine whether SKN-1 is
regulated by a nuclear export mechanism, we perturbed
nuclear export by targeting CRM-1, the C. elegans or-
tholog of a vertebrate exportin (Lo et al. 2004), using
RNAi. Depletion of CRM-1 by RNAi in wild-type ani-
mals expressing SKN-1⬋GFP did not result in increased
nuclear localization of SKN-1 in the absence of oxidative
stress (J.H. An and T.K. Blackwell, unpubl.). Further-
more, treatment of sek-1 mutants expressing SKN-
1⬋GFP with crm-1 RNAi did not induce nuclear accu-
mulation of SKN-1 even in the presence of arsenite stress
(data not shown). We next analyzed the nuclear localiza-
tion of a SKN-1 protein to which the SV40 nuclear lo-
calization signal (NLS) had been added. Addition of the
SV40 NLS to SKN-1⬋GFP failed to promote nuclear lo-
calization of SKN-1 in sek-1 mutants in response to ar-
senite stress (data not shown). These results suggest that
PMK-1 phosphorylation of SKN-1 may not effect nuclear
localization through the nuclear import/export machin-
ery.

To gain insight into the mechanism(s) underlying the
nuclear localization of SKN-1 in response to oxidative
stress, we analyzed the subcellular distribution of SKN-1
in mammalian cells. When Flag-tagged SKN-1 was ex-
pressed in HeLa cells, SKN-1 was localized in the
nucleus even in the absence of any stresses (Supplemen-
tary Fig. S4). This indicates that SKN-1 can be constitu-
tively localized in the nucleus in mammalian cells.
Taken together, these results raise the possibility that
the cells in the intestine of C. elegans harbor an inhibitor
that acts to sequester SKN-1 in the cytoplasm and that
phosphorylation of SKN-1 by PMK-1 leads to the release

of SKN-1 from this inhibitor and the nuclear accumula-
tion of SKN-1. SKN-1 is distantly related to the Nrf pro-
teins (Walker et al. 2000), which orchestrate the major
oxidative stress response in vertebrates (Hayes and Mc-
Mahon 2001). Interestingly, mammalian Nrf proteins are
also regulated in response to oxidative stress by a cyto-
plasmic retention mechanism (Itoh et al. 1999). Our find-
ings on the regulation of SKN-1 by PMK-1-mediated
phosphorylation may reflect modes of p38 MAPK signal-
ing conserved through the Nrf proteins.

The PMK-1 p38 MAPK pathway is further involved in
asymmetric cell fate in neuronal development (Sagasti et
al. 2001; Tanaka-Hino et al. 2002), the nematode defense
to pathogens (Kim et al. 2002), and the stress response
(Fig. 5). Most recently, it has been shown that the tir-1
gene encoding a highly conserved Toll/IL-1 resistance
(TIR) domain protein is required for C. elegans resistance
to microbial pathogens (Couillault et al. 2004; Liberati et
al. 2004) and asymmetric cell fate decision during neu-
ronal development (Chuang and Bargmann 2005). How-
ever, we found that the tir-1 deletion mutation had no
effect on arsenite sensitivity (data not shown). These re-
sults suggest that the upstream MAPKKK components
that mediate stress-dependent activation of PMK-1 are
different from those that mediate neuronal asymmetric
development and innate immunity. It is still unknown
what components function downstream of PMK-1 in ei-
ther innate immunity or neuronal asymmetric develop-
ment. We show that phosphorylation of SKN-1 by
PMK-1 induces nuclear translocation of this transcrip-
tion factor and activation of gcs-1 gene expression in
response to oxidative stress. Thus, the present findings
suggest that SKN-1 is of central importance for this
stress-resistance function of the C. elegans p38 MAPK
pathway.

at 20°C and fed with bacteria of the OP50 strain, as described by Brenner
(1974). The alleles used in this study were N2 Bristol as the wild type,

Plasmid constructions
The skn-1⬋gfp plasmid was described previously (An and Blackwell
2003). The skn-1(S74, 340A)⬋gfp transgene variant was constructed from
the skn-1⬋gfp transgene by the Quick Change method (Stratagene). To
construct fusions of GST to SKN-1, skn-1 cDNA was subcloned into the
pGEX3 vector. Mutated GST–SKN-1(S74A), GST–SKN-1(S340A), and
GST–SKN-1(S74, 340A) were constructed from pGEX3-skn-1 by PCR.
The Psek-1⬋sek-1⬋gfp plasmid was described previously (Tanaka-Hino
et al. 2002). The ges-1 promoter, a fragment that containing 2.5 kb up-
stream of the initiation ATG, was constructed from genomic DNA by
PCR and subcloned into the GFP vector pPD97.75 by SphI–SalI site
(pPD95.75-Pges-1). For constructing Pges-1⬋sek-1⬋gfp, an XbaI–KpnI
fragment of the sek-1 ORF from Psek-1⬋sek-1⬋gfp was subcloned into
pPD95.75-Pges-1.

Transgenic analyses
Strains carrying the Psek-1⬋sek-1⬋gfp or Pges-1⬋sek-1⬋gfp transgene
were generated by injecting DNA (50 ng/mL) with the rol-6 marker
(pRF4) at 50 ng/mL into the gonads of young adult N2 animals as de-
scribed (Mello et al. 1991). These extrachromosomal arrays were trans-
ferred to sek-1 animals by crossing. The skn-1⬋gfp-integrated animals
and Pgcs-1⬋gfp extrachromosomal lines were described previously (An
and Blackwell 2003). The skn-1⬋gfp extrachromosomal lines were gen-
erated by injecting DNA (2.5 ng/mL) with the rol-6 marker (50 ng/mL)
into N2 animals. Some transgenes were transferred to sek-1, pmk-1, and
skn-1 mutant animals by crossing.

Arsenite assays
To determine the activation of PMK-1 by arsenite stress, animals grown
on normal NGM agar plates were transferred to 1.5-mL test tubes in M9
buffer. Worms were then incubated with M9 buffer or M9 buffer con-
taining 3 or 5 mM sodium arsenite for 30 min at 20°C and subjected to
immunoblotting. To assay for arsenite toxicity, well-fed young adults
were picked and transferred to normal NGM agar plates or NGM agar
plates containing 3 or 5 mM sodium arsenite. Worms were incubated at
20°C, and the number of surviving worms were counted at the indicated
times. To investigate the effect of arsenite stress on gcs-1 promoter-
driven GFP expression, N2, sek-1 and pmk-1 animals carrying the Pgcs-
1⬋gfp transgene were treated with M9 buffer or M9 buffer containing 5
mM arsenite for 1 h at 20°C. These animals were then transferred to
NGM plates and incubated for 3 h at 20°C. To investigate nuclear accu-
mulation of SKN-1⬋GFP, animals carrying the skn-1⬋gfp transgene
were treated with or without 5 mM arsenite in M9 buffer for 1 h at 20°C.
These animals were then placed on 2% agarose plates on slide and im-
mobilized by 0.5% phenoxypropanol, covered with a microscope slip,
and observed by fluorescent microscopy (Carl Zeiss).

Immunoblotting
Animals were homogenized in a sample buffer (65 mM Tris-HCl at pH
6.8, 3% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 5% b-mercaptoethanol) for immuno-
blotting. Anti-phospho p38 monoclonal antibody was purchased from
Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. We used a 1:500 dilution of anti-phospho
p38 antibody and 1:1000 dilution of anti-PMK-1 antibody.

In vitro kinase assay
Transfection and immunoprecipitation using HEK293 cells were carried
out as described previously (Kawasaki et al. 1999; Ninomiya-Tsuji et al.
1999). Bacterially expressed GST–SKN-1 was purified and used as a sub-
strate for HA-PMK-1. For immunoprecipitaion, anti-HA antibody Y-11
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) was used. For immunoblotting, anti-HA
antibody Y-11 and anti-Flag antibody M2 (Sigma) were used.
