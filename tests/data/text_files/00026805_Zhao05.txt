Identification of cis-regulatory elements and their binding pro-
teins constitutes an important part of understanding gene function
and regulation. It is well accepted that co-expressed genes tend to
share transcriptional elements. However, recent findings indicate
that co-expression data show poor correlation with co-regulation
data even in unicellular yeast. This motivates us to experimentally
explore whether it is possible that co-expressed genes are subject to
differential regulatory control using the excretory cell of Caeno-
rhabditis elegans as an example. Excretory cell is a functional equiv-
alent of human kidney. Transcriptional regulation of gene expres-
sion in the cell is largely unknown. We isolated a 10-bp excretory
cell-specific cis-element, Ex-1, from a pgp-12 promoter. The signif-
icance of the element has been demonstrated by its capacity of con-
verting an intestine-specific promoter into an excretory cell-spe-
cific one. We also isolated a cDNA encoding an Ex-1 binding
transcription factor, DCP-66, using a yeast one-hybrid screen. Role
of the factor in regulation of pgp-12 expression has been demon-
strated both in vitro and in vivo. Search for occurrence of Ex-1
revealsthatonlyasmallportionofexcretorycell-specificpromoters
contain Ex-1. Two other distinct cis-elements isolated from two dif-
ferent promoters can also dictate the excretory cell-specific expres-
sion but are independent of regulation by DCP-66. The results indi-
cate that distinct regulatory elements are able to mediate the similar
expression patterns.

Given the increasing number of genome sequences, a major challenge
is to understand the non-coding sequences of the genomes. The tem-
poral and spatial expression pattern of genes is controlled by a variety of
short cis-acting DNA elements (cis-elements) that act as binding sites
for transcription factors. These cis-elements have frequently been iden-
tified within the non-coding sequences of different genomes (1–4).
Therefore, identification of cis-regulatory elements and their binding
proteins constitute an important part of deciphering the role of non-
coding sequences. Investigation of the regulation of tissue-specific
expression began over a dozen years ago in Caenorhabditis elegans (5),
and has been greatly facilitated by the use of reporter genes such as
green fluorescent protein (GFP)2 (6), but progress is limited because of
the complexity and labor intensity of the analysis. In C. elegans, cis- and

trans-regulation of tissue-specific gene expression is known only for a
few tissues such as intestine (7), excretory duct cell (8), another cell of
excretory system along with the excretory cell, and muscle (1). Many of
such investigations usually have been done by searching for over-repre-
sented sequences within a subset of promoters of co-expressed genes.
However, recent investigations in yeast demonstrated poor correlation
between co-expression and co-regulation (9, 10), suggesting a substan-
tial number of co-expressed genes might not be co-regulated. To test
this hypothesis, we use C. elegans excretory cell as an example.

Excretory cell, also called the excretory canal cell, is the largest mono-
nucleate tubular cell in C. elegans, making it an excellent model for
investigating the morphogenesis of biological tube. It functions in part
as a kidney, excreting saline fluid via the duct and pore to maintain the
salt balance of the animal and probably to remove metabolites (11, 12).
Its unique morphology makes it straightforward and unambiguous to
identify the cell in vivo. Mutation of several genes has previously been
reported to affect morphogenesis of the excretory cell. For example,
disruption of the POU homeobox gene, ceh-6, leads to inappropriate
canal structures in C. elegans (13). Loss of function for unc-53 blocks the
progression of canal development (14). Mutations in a mucin encoding
gene, let-653, result in an extremely large canal lumen (15). Several
other mutants have also been isolated, which show enlarged canal
lumens termed cysts (12). However, regulatory mechanisms that con-
trol tissue-specific expression in the excretory cell have not been
reported. Here, we have chosen the C. elegans excretory cell as a model
to address two questions: what is the regulatory mechanism, i.e. cis-
element and its binding protein, which controls the tissue-specific
expressions in the cell; and whether the excretory cell-specific genes
share the same regulatory mechanisms.

Construction of Reporter Genes and Site-directed Mutagenesis—
Promoter::reporter fusion constructs were built by the fusion PCR tech-
nique as previously described (16). Site-directed deletions were per-
formed by similar fusion techniques. The two primer sets were designed
to amplify fragments upstream and downstream of the sequence to be
deleted. The reverse primer used to amplify the upstream region con-
tains an overhang that is complementary to the forward primer used to
amplify the downstream region. The two fragments were fused together
by PCR using the forward primer to amplify the upstream fragment and
reverse primers to amplify the downstream fragment. The resulting
PCR products were sequenced to confirm the correctness of the
deletions.

DNA Transformation and Microscopy—DNA transformation and
microscopy were performed as described (17). The DNA concentra-
tions for the GFP construct and dpy-5 rescuing plasmid in the injection
mixture were 10 and 100 ng/␮l. Pictures were taken for 20 worms each
for at least 3 independent lines using the same exposure time (1.05 s).
GFP intensity was measured for at least three independent strains using
public domain NIH Image program version 1.60.3 Only cell bodies were
measured. Chromosomal integration of the pgp-12 transgenic strain
was performed as described (19). The transgenic worms
for
pgp-12::GFP were exposed to low dose x-ray irradiation (1500 R) to
induce double-stranded breaks in chromosomes. The resulting F2
worms were screened for integrants.

Yeast One-hybrid Screening—Yeast one-hybrid screen was per-
formed according to the manufacturer’s instruction (MATCHMAKER
One-Hybrid System; Clontech). Briefly, three tandem copies of the Ex-1
element were synthesized as two reverse complementary strands with
EcoRI and XbaI overhangs at the ends. Annealing of the two reverse
complementary single-stranded DNAs yielded an EcoRI and XbaI adap-
tor. The resulting adaptor was cloned upstream of the HIS3 reporter
plasmid pHISi digested with EcoRI and XbaI. The reporter plasmid was
then integrated into yeast strain YM4271 to generate the reporter strain.
Background growth of this reporter strain was ablated by titrating with
30 mM 3-aminotrizole (Sigma). Screening was carried out by transform-
ing worm cDNA library RB2 (A gift from Dr. Robert Barstead) into the
Ex-1-integrated pHISi-1 reporter strain using the LiOAc strategy.
Around 2 million clones were screened. Plasmids were retrieved from
the yeast colonies growing in His-Leu-agar plates with 30 mM 3-amino-
trizole. The cDNA inserts were sequenced and then compared against
Wormbase records. To confirm yeast one-hybrid screening results, the
resulting positive clones were transformed back into the Ex-1-inte-
grated YM4721 strain. The yeast colonies from each transformation
were then streaked onto His-Leu-agar plates with 30 mM 3-amino-
trizole. The growth of the streaked yeast colonies was compared with
control (YM7271 with Ex-1 reporter integrated within) after 3 days
incubation at 30 °C.

Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays

(EMSA)—Primers were
designed so that the dcp-66 cDNA sequence isolated from the one-
hybrid screen was amplified as template for protein production. dcp-66
cDNA encoding 122 amino acids that contains the predicted zinc finger
domain was used as template to produce protein using the TNT
QuikChange Transcription/Translation System from Promega. The
resulting protein was quantified using the Pierce Micro BCATM Protein

3 Scion (rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image).

Assay Kit (catalog number 23227) with Test Tube Procedure and SDS-
polyacrylamide gel analysis. The three tandem Ex-1 or a single copy of
Ex-2 or Ex-3 were labeled by the Pierce Biotin 3⬘ End DNA Labeling Kit
(catalog number 89818). The labeling efficiency was determined as
described by the manufacturer. The labeled Ex-1, Ex-2, or Ex-3 were
annealed with its reverse complementary strand to form a double-
stranded oligo. EMSA was performed using the Pierce LightShiftTM
Chemiluminescent EMSA Kit (catalog number 20148X) following man-
ufacturer’s specifications.

RNA Interference—RNA interference by feeding was done using feed-
ing library provided by Ahringer laboratory (20) as described. Five GFP
expressing L4 worms were transferred onto plates seeded with RNA
interference bacteria or control bacteria (containing empty RNA inter-
ference vector) at room temperature. After 2 days, 30 GFP expressing L2
or L3 worms were transferred onto three replica plates seeded with the
same bacteria as mentioned above and checked for GFP expression after
incubation for another day. Loss of GFP expression was calculated as
average percentage from the three plates.

Genetic Analysis of the dcp-66 Deletion Mutant—The deletion allele
dcp-66(gk370) was isolated by the C. elegans Reverse Genetics Core
Facility, which is part of the International C. elegans Gene Knock-out
Consortium, using a PCR screen of a mutant collection of TMP/UV-
mutagenized animals. Homozygous dcp-66(gk370) worm are inviable
and most of them die as small, disintegrated adults. Allele gk370 was
balanced by pharyngeal GFP marked translocation hT2 in the strain
VC924.

Outcrossing was performed as follows: Four VC924 worms were
crossed with four N2 male at 20 °C. Four F1 self-progeny without GFP
(gk370 heterozygote) were mated with six F1 male progeny with GFP.
GFP marked F2 crossing progeny were transferred into individual
plates. The presence of gk370 in the F2 crossing progeny was followed by
segregation of inviable small and disintegrated adults. The process was
repeated another three times and the resulting outcrossed strains were
used for subsequent analysis.

The outcrossed VC924 worms were mated with N2 male. 40 cross
progeny without GFP were transferred onto one fresh plate and allowed
to lay eggs for 3 h at 20 °C and then picked off the plate. The laid eggs
were scored and phenotypes were examined every 12 h.

BC10210 worms carrying the integrated transgene pgp-12::GFP were
crossed to N2 male and the resulting F1 GFP male progeny were crossed
into the outcrossed VC924 hermaphrodites. The progeny with GFP in
the excretory cell but not in the pharynx were picked up for phenotypic
analysis. Similar crossings were done between the outcrossed VC924
and BC6148, BC10257, or BC13573, which carries
transgenes
pgp-4::DsRed, pgp-3::GFP, or nas-31::GFP, respectively.

Rescue analysis to verify the genetic deletion was performed by the
generation of transgenic strains carrying both the 9307-bp genomic
regions of the dcp-66 and pgp-12::GFP construct. The region was ampli-
fied from N2 genomic DNA containing 3188 bp upstream of the trans-
lation start and 1882 bp downstream of the translation stop codon using
forward primer, gaatggttttcaagagaaaggcta,
and reverse primer,
tggagagagtatgttcactcaattaca. The resulting transgenic worms were
crossed to N2 male, and F1 GFP male progeny were crossed to the
outcrossed VC924 worms. The progeny with GFP in the excretory cell
but not pharynx were plated and the presence of the gk370 allele was
followed as mentioned above.

Bioinformatic Analysis—Promoters of eight genes that are exclu-
sively expressed in the excretory cell were scanned for 10-mers that
show over 80% identity to the Ex-1 sequence. The resulting hits were
used to formulate the Ex-1 profile and generated a sequence logo by

cell expression on a promoter not usually expressed in this cell, i.e.
ectopic expression. A 286-bp intestine-specific promoter, Ce-haf-4,
drives moderate GFP expression in the intestine (TABLE ONE). A sin-
gle copy of Ex-1 fused to the 5⬘ end of the promoter does not cause any
changes in its expression pattern. However, Ex-L-Ex-1-Ex-R joined at
the 5⬘ end of 286-bp Ce-haf-4 successfully change expression patterns
of the promoter, i.e. from intestine-specific expression to expression in
both intestine and excretory cell (TABLE ONE and supplemental Fig.
S1). Interestingly, the reversed complementary sequence for Ex-L-Ex-
1-Ex-R joined on the 5⬘ end of Ce-haf-4 did not cause any changes in the
expression patterns, indicating that Ex-1 and its flanking sequences
work in an orientation dependent manner. In addition, the Ex-L-Ex-1-
Ex-R joined at the 5⬘ end of the 498-bp Ce-haf-4 cannot change expres-
sion patterns of the promoter, suggesting the three elements work in a
distance-dependent manner (TABLE ONE). Ex-L-Ex-1-Ex-R are the
minimum sequences that can cause ectopic expressions in the excretory
cell. Strikingly, the three elements together with its upstream 48-bp
sequence from Ce-pgp-12 were able to make the 286-bp Ce-haf-4 drive
GFP expression only in the excretory cell but not in the intestine when
they were joined at the 5⬘ end the promoter. The Ex-L-Ex-1-Ex-R
sequence was also tested on the 5⬘ end of two other promoters: a
1724-bp pharynx-specific promoter Ce-pgp-14 and a 1193-bp intes-
tine-specific promoter Ce-pmp-1. No changes were observed in expres-
sion patterns of the two promoters (TABLE ONE), again implying that
there is a requirement for distance to the start codon for Ex-1 and its
flanking sequences to function properly.

Given the significance of the 48-bp sequence in directing excretory
cell-specific expression, we asked whether it can cause ectopic expres-
sion in the excretory cell by itself. Interestingly, the 286-bp Ce-haf-4
promoter did not give observable expression in both the excretory cell
and the intestine when the 48-bp sequence was placed at its 5⬘ end
(TABLE ONE), indicating that the 48-bp sequence function as a sup-
pressor for the Ce-haf-4-mediated intestine expression. However,
inclusion of the 48-bp sequence at the 5⬘ end of the 498-bp Ce-haf-4 did
not affect the expression. To map the essential part of the 48-bp
sequence responsible for the observed inhibition, we split the sequence
into two 24-bp fragments and fused each of them at the 5⬘ end of the
Ce-haf-4, neither of them can significantly inhibit Ce-haf-4-mediated
intestine expression. The central 24 bp of the 48-bp sequence fused at
the 5⬘ end of Ce-haf-4 only caused modest suppression, indicating that
most parts of the 48-bp sequence are involved in such inhibition. Scan-
ning the 48-bp sequence against TransFac (23) did not give any hits.
Alignment of C. elegans and C. briggsae pgp-12 promoters showed little
conservation within the region. Joining the 48-bp C. briggsae sequence
upstream of Ex-L within Cb-pgp-12 at the 5⬘ end of Ce-haf-4 did not
alter Ce-haf-4-mediated expression (TABLE ONE). We fused the 48-bp
sequence along with Ex-L-Ex-1-Ex-R to the 5⬘ end of two other promot-
ers, i.e. pharynx-specific Ce-pgp-14 and intestine-specific promoter Ce-
pmp-1. No obvious expression changes were observed as opposed to
expression without the grafted sequence. The results show that the
48-bp sequence work as a suppressor for Ce-haf-4 at a certain distance
to the start codon. It is unknown whether the 48-bp sequence serves as
a binding site for suppressors or interferes with the binding of intestine-
specific transcription factors to the Ce-haf-4.

Identification of Transcription Factor That Binds Ex-1 Using One-
hybrid Screening—To identify the Ex-1 binding transcription factors,
we performed a yeast one-hybrid screen (Clontech) using three tandem
Ex-1s as a bait. Two positive clones were isolated from the screen. One
of the inserts contained an in-frame cDNA sequence for R05D11.3.
However, no substantial DNA binding domain was found within the

WebLogo (21). The resulting profile was used to scan 82 excretory non-
exclusive and 223 non-excretory cell gene promoters (19) for hits with
over 80% identity to Ex-1 sequence.

RESULTS

Promoters of pgp-12 and its Caenorhabditis briggsae Ortholog Drive
GFP/DsRed Expression in the Excretory Cell—To identify cis-regulatory
elements that direct specific expressions in the excretory cell, we chose
Ce-pgp-12, a 3410-bp excretory cell exclusive promoter from pgp-12
(17) and fused it to GFP and DsRed to generate transgenic animals. As
expected, the promoter drove both GFP and DsRed expression exclu-
sively in the excretory cell at all developmental stages (Fig. 1). The dual
reporter genes were used to exclude the possibility that the resulting
expression was the artifact of reporter rather than the result of the
promoter used. To determine whether the observed pattern is con-
served between C. elegans and its sister species, C. briggsae, which has
been diverged from the former around 100 million years (22), we gen-
erated the fusion construct between GFP and a 1160-bp C. briggsae
orthologous region of Ce-pgp-12, Cb-pgp-12. The resulting construct
was introduced into C. briggsae AF16 strain. The same expression pat-
tern was observed as that of Ce-pgp-12 (data not shown). To further
confirm the conserved regulatory mechanisms between the two species,
we reciprocally introduced fusion constructs from one species into the
other, and observed the indistinguishable expression patterns in either
species, indicating the conserved regulatory mechanisms for the expres-
sion of the two orthologous genes.

A 10-bp Element, Ex-1, Is Critical for Driving Excretory Cell-specific
Expression—To locate the cis-element that drives the excretory cell-
specific expression, we performed a series of truncations on the 3410-bp
Ce-pgp-12 to determine definitive regions responsible for excretory
cell-specific expression. As a result, we were able to identify a 10-bp
element, termed hereafter as Ex-1 with the sequence ccatacatta, dele-
tion of which caused complete loss of the expression driven by the
promoter (Fig. 2A). A search of the TransFac data base (23) indicates
that Ex-1 is a novel cis-element. Alignment of Ce-pgp-12 and its
C. briggsae orthologous region, Cb-pgp-12, showed perfect conserva-
tion of Ex-1. The flanking sequences, however, are not well conserved
(Fig. 2B). Site-directed removal of Ex-1 but not Ex-L or Ex-R could
completely abolish GFP expression. Therefore, Ex-1 is the most critical
element for the observable expressions. Ex-L and Ex-R also contribute
to the expression because removal of them caused decreased expression
(Fig. 2A).

For further confirmation that Ex-1 drives tissue-specific expression
in the excretory cell, we examined whether Ex-1 could confer excretory

protein. A fusion construct of the R05D11.3 promoter with a GFP gave
exclusive expression in the intestine but not in the excretory cell (data
not shown), suggesting that it may be a false positive cDNA clone. The
other insert matches a cDNA sequence of dcp-66. It shows protein
similarity to the deacetylase complex protein (24). The protein also
contains a putative glucocorticoid receptor-like zinc finger DNA-bind-
ing domain (residues 432–501) identified by scanning the InterPro data
base (25), suggesting that it is a DNA-binding protein. PSORT II
(psort.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp) predicted the nuclear localization of DCP-66
(73.9%, data not shown). Alignment of DCP-66 amino sequences with
its homologs from other organisms revealed two conserved fragments.
The alignment close to the amino terminus seems conserved only
among vertebrates, whereas the one near the carboxyl terminus shows
high conservation across all species and contains a putative zinc finger
domain (supplemental Fig. S2).

dcp-66 Is Also Expressed in Excretory Cell and Binds Ex-1 in Vitro—
To confirm the interaction of DCP-66 with Ex-1, we generated
promoter::GFP transgenic animals for the gene. The 2525-bp promoter of
the gene drove GFP expression in the excretory cell in adult, larva, and
embryo. Weak expression was observed in the excretory cell, pharynx,
vulva, and posterior neurons in adult worms (Fig. 3A). Strong expression in
the excretory cell and weak expression in the pharynx were seen in larva
(Fig. 3B). Embryonic expression was also seen in the excretory cell (Fig. 3C).
Overlapping expression patterns of dcp-66 and pgp-12 suggest that the
former regulate the later expression by binding of Ex-1 within its promoter.
To examine whether the DCP-66 binds Ex-1 in vitro, we performed EMSA

using biotin-labeled three tandem Ex-1 sequences as a probe. As shown in
Fig. 3D, the 122 amino acids from DCP-66 that encodes the predicted zinc
finger domain binds the Ex-1 element in vitro. Taken together, we demon-
strate that DCP-66 binds Ex-1 both in vivo and in vitro.

DCP-66 Specifically Up-regulates pgp-12 Expression—To examine
the regulatory activity of DCP-66 on Ce-pgp-12mediated excretory cell-
specific expression in vivo, we crossed the integrated transgene,
pgp-12::GFP into the homozygous dcp-66 (gk370) mutant (see “Experi-
mental Procedures”). Deletion of the gene resulted in significant sup-
pression of pgp-12 expression in the excretory cell (Fig. 4, A and B). The
strain containing integrated pgp-12::GFP gains weak GFP expression in
the pharynx. Compared with the wild type strain (Fig. 4A), loss of dcp-66
significantly inhibited expressions in the excretory cells with little effect
on GFP expression in the pharynx (Fig. 4B). To determine whether it is
the loss of dcp-66 that caused the decreased expression, we used a
9307-bp fragment spanning the N2 genomic region for dcp-66 to rescue
the homozygous mutant strain containing pgp-12::GFP (see “Experi-
mental Procedures”). Three independent rescued lines were generated.
Apparently increased pgp-12::GFP expression was observed in all the
rescued lines as opposed to that of the dcp-66 mutant (Fig. 4C, TABLE
TWO). To test whether the loss of dcp-66 can also down-regulate
expression of other excretory cell-specific genes whose promoters do
not contain the Ex-1 element, we chose pgp-4 that also shows exclusive
expression in the excretory cell (17) but does not contain any Ex-1
element. It is interesting to note that deletion of dcp-66 does not affect
the expression of pgp-4::DsRed (Fig. 4D), suggesting that dcp-66 specif-

and 18% of them arrest during embryogenesis and 82% die as small
adults. Disintegrated tissues such as desiccated germline and shrunken
intestine are frequently observed in adult, which might be caused by
improperly regulated osmolarity, a major role of the excretory cell (11).
Deletion of dcp-66 also resulted in defective vulva (supplemental Fig.
S3).

Promoters of Many Excretory Cell-specific Genes Do Not Contain Ex-1
Element—Given the mapped cis-regulatory element, we asked whether
the genes co-expressed in the excretory cell are regulated by the same
element. We define those as co-expressed genes if their promoters drive
GFP expression exclusively or non-exclusively in the excretory cell from
larvae to the adult stage. As an initial search for occurrence of Ex-1 in
other excretory cell-specific 1-kb promoters, we scanned promoters of
eight co-expressed genes whose promoters drive exclusive GFP expres-
sion in the excretory cell (19) for hits with over 80% identity to the Ex-1
sequence. Totally eight hits were found in four of the eight promoters,
including Ce-pgp-12 and three other promoters (supplemental Fig. 4A
and supplemental Table 1). Four of the co-expressed gene promoters do
not produce any hit, implying they may not be regulated by binding of
DCP-66 to Ex-1. This is supported by the observation that RNA inter-
ference against dcp-66 showed a substantial inhibition of GFP expres-
sion driven by the promoters containing the Ex-1 hit, i.e. pgp-12,
F48E8.3, DH11.3, and Y8G1A.2, but no significant inhibition for those
whose promoters do not contain Ex-1 hits (data not shown), indicating
that independent regulatory pathways exist for control of excretory cell-
specific expression. We used the eight hits to generate the Ex-1 profile

tion factor that up-regulates excretory cell-specific gene expression by
binding to Ex-1. The homozygous deletion mutant for dcp-66 is inviable

and produced a sequence logo for this motif (supplemental Fig. 4B)
using WebLogo (21). The resulting profile was used to scan a subset of
82 excretory non-exclusive (drive GFP expression in both the excretory
cell and in other tissues) and 223 non-excretory cell gene promoters
(drive GFP in posterior neurons but not in the excretory cell) (19).
Surprisingly, only 10 of the 82 (12.2%) excretory non-exclusive promot-
ers contain positive hits, suggesting again that there are other cis-regu-
latory elements independent of Ex-1 that are able to drive the expression
of these excretory cell genes (supplemental Table 2). Notably, Ex-1 is
significantly over-represented in excretory cell-specific promoters
compared with non-excretory cell ones (12.2 versus 4.0%, p ⬍ 0.05,
Fisher’s Exact Test) (supplemental Fig. 4A, supplemental Table 3).

Different cis-Elements Can Mediate Similar Expression Patterns in
Excretory Cell—To map the cis-elements from promoters that direct
excretory cell-specific expression but do not contain Ex-1, we chose two

such promoters for further analysis. One is for pgp-3, an excretory cell
non-exclusive gene (expressed in both excretory cell and intestine (17))
with similar function annotation to pgp-12. The other one is nas-31, an
excretory cell exclusive gene encoding putative astacin-like protein. The
two genes were chosen to examine the regulatory elements for the
shared expression patterns between related or unrelated genes. We used
similar strategies as those used for pgp-12 to map the critical elements in
the two promoter sequences and were able to identify a 26- (Ex-2) and
25-bp element (Ex-3) within the promoters of pgp-3 and nas-31 with the
following sequences, respectively: CTCACAAAATATAAATATGG-
TAATTC and GTTTCGAAAGTTCATCACCCCCAAC (Fig. 5, A and
B). Deletion of the two individual elements abolished the GFP expres-
sion driven by each promoter. The two elements are strongly conserved
between C. elegans and C. briggsae. They are not found in the promoter
of pgp-12. Reciprocal introduction of promoter::GFP constructs for both
pgp-3::GFP and nas-31::GFP into the two species yields the same expres-
sion patterns, indicating that regulatory mechanisms of excretory cell-
specific expression between the two species are conserved. To examine
the significance of the two elements in directing excretory cell-specific
expression, we joined the individual Ex-2 or Ex-3 at the 5⬘ end of the
286-bp haf-4 promoter followed by GFP. Both of the two fragments are
able to yield ectopic expression in the excretory cell (Fig. 5, A and B).
These results demonstrate the significant roles of the two elements in
directing excretory cell-specific expression. Scanning of the two ele-
ments against the TransFac data base did not give any hits, implying the
two elements are novel excretory cell-specific cis-elements. Both of the
two elements show no obvious similarity to Ex-1 and sequences similar
to the two elements are not found within the pgp-12 promoter, indicat-
ing different cis-elements are able to mediate excretory cell-specific
expression. To test whether excretory cell-specific expression of pgp-3
or nas-31 is under control of DCP-66, we crossed animals containing
transgenes pgp-3::GFP or nas-31::GFP into the dcp-66 null mutant
VC924. The results show that loss of DCP-66 does not significantly
reduce the expression level of the two transgenes (TABLE TWO). The
slightly decreased GFP levels might be the consequences of gk370 allele.
In agreement with this observation, DCP-66 did not bind Ex-2 or Ex-3
in vitro (supplemental Fig. 5). Taken together, we conclude that Ex-1,
Ex-2, and Ex-3 are all able to mediate similar expression in the excretory
cell but through independent regulatory pathways.

FIGURE 6. Excretory cell-specific gene expressions mediated by distinct cis-regula-
tory elements. Promoters of pgp-12, pgp-3, and nas-31 all drive GFP expressions in
excretory cell. Three distinct cis-elements, Ex-1, Ex-2, and Ex-3, were identified at ⫺249,

ply treated as co-expressed gene sets to search for cis-regulatory ele-
ments. Understanding the mechanisms for such discrepancy could
improve the accuracy for functional prediction of genes based on co-
expression data. Here we demonstrated that distinct cis-regulatory ele-
ments or regulatory pathways could mediate similar expression patterns
in the excretory cell (Figs. 2, 5, and 6), which provides at least in part an
explanation for the above discrepancy. Ex-1 can be found in only 12.2%
of 82 excretory cell-specific promoters (supplemental Fig. 4A), indicat-
ing that 87.8% of excretory cell-specific expression is mediated by dif-
ferent cis-regulatory elements such as Ex-2 and Ex-3. Using a subset of
the 82 excretory cell-specific promoters as the co-expression dataset
will have a relatively low signal to noise ratio, i.e. 12.2%, which may
prevent a cis-element discovery program from identifying biologically
relevant cis-elements. This phenomenon might not be uncommon for
other expression patterns. Poor performance of co-expression data by
itself may also explain the observed discrepancy. Combination of
expression data and comparative genomic data with functional annota-
tions or subcellular localizations is reported to increase the likelihood to
cluster co-regulated genes (29). It may increase the possibility to cluster
the real co-expressed genes if data are collected from independent data
sources, such as those from microarray, localization, and common tran-
scription factor binding sites (10). Many of the co-expressed genes may
not be truly co-regulated but only spuriously or superficially co-ex-
pressed. Poor correlation between co-expression and co-regulation may
be even more evident in multicellular organisms because of the addi-
tional dimension (spatial) involved. However, we do not preclude the
possibility that many of the carefully selected co-expression datasets do
reflect the consequence of co-regulation, such as shared cis-elements
and transcription factors. Therefore, caution should be exercised when
choosing subsets of co-expressed genes for characterization of their
cis-regulatory sites and binding factors. On the other hand, the presence
of the same cis-regulatory element may not necessarily define the same
expression patterns. For example, as shown in supplemental Fig. 4A,
around 5% of the 223 neuronal but not excretory cell-specific promoters
also contain elements with over 80% identity to Ex-1. It is possible that
these putative elements cannot be recognized by DCP-66 or the pres-
ence of inhibitory elements around the Ex-1 that suppresses the Ex-1
function. It is well accepted that transcription factors usually function
within a protein complex consisting of multiple components. Each
component may bind its own cognate DNA element or work as the
regulatory binding partner without interacting with chromosomal
DNA. A specific expression pattern is determined by a combination of
these components. A protein factor may works as an activator in one
complex and suppressor in the other depending on the composition of
the complex. This might be the case for DCP-66. Human and Xenopus

drives strong GFP expression in larvae and medium GFP expression in adult. The trun-
cated version of the promoter containing the 823- or 502-bp sequence from the start
codon did not significantly alter the expression. Decreased GFP expression was observed
in larvae with the truncated 292-bp promoter. Truncation of another 26 bp, termed Ex-2,
caused complete loss of expression in both adult and larvae. Site-directed removal of the
Ex-2 within the 502-bp promoter also abolished the expression. Numbers shown are % of
the expression level against that of 1050-bp promoter with the sample size in parenthe-
ses. B, a 1012-bp pgp-3 promoter drives strong GFP expression in both larvae and adult.
A 25-bp element, termed Ex-3, was mapped within the nas-31 promoter using a similar
strategy as described in A. Numbers shown are % of expression level against that of
1012-bp promoter with the sample size in the parentheses. Both Ex-2 and Ex-3 can cause
ectopic expression in the excretory cell when joined at the 5⬘ end of 286-bp haf-4
promoter.

DISCUSSION

With the availability of complete genome sequences, huge amounts
of functional genomic data have been generated to determine functional
links between genes. Gene co-expression is such a type of link that has
been frequently used to determine the frequency of co-regulation to
predict or infer the cellular function of unknown genes (9, 10). However,
recent investigations show that large scale transcription factor binding
sites by ChIP-on-chip experiments reveal very limited correlation
between co-expression and the number of shared transcription factor
binding sites (27, 28). This discrepancy may not be uncommon. For
example, a terminal differentiation gene may be regulated by its
upstream transcriptional factor, which is also expressed in the same
tissue. The factor itself is subject to regulation by its own upstream
components within the same transcriptional cascade. Many of the com-
ponents within such a cascade could be found in the same tissue in
certain time windows. However, it is unlikely for these genes share tran-
scriptional elements. Problems could arise if such components are sim-

homologs of DCP-66 were identified as a component of a gene silencing
complex (24, 30). However, we showed that DCP-66 works as a trans-
activator in C. elegans. This can be partially explained by the fact that the
protein shows significant conservation in the DNA binding domain but
not in the other domain at the amino terminus that is only conserved
among vertebrate homologs (supplemental Fig. 2). It is possible that the
DCP-66 can play dual roles as both suppressor and activator, such as
p53 does in cell growth and death decisions (31, 32). Given the signifi-
cance of Ex-L and Ex-R in pgp-12 expression (Fig. 2A) and inability of
single Ex-1 to yield ectopic expression (TABLE ONE), we proposed that
DCP-66 work synergistically with other partners that might bind ele-
ments Ex-L and/or Ex-R (Fig. 6). Further research needs to be done to
test the two possibilities. It should also be noted that loss of DCP-66 did
not completely eliminate the excretory cell-specific expression driven
by the pgp-12 promoter, suggesting some other factors may be involved
in such a regulation. Identification of Ex-1, Ex-2, and Ex-3 as distinct
elements in directing excretory cell-specific expression as well as differ-
ential responses of pgp-12::GFP, pgp-3::GFP, and nas-31::GFP express-
ing strains to loss of dcp-66 indicate that there exist multiple pathways
that regulate excretory cell-specific expression. Selective cross-talk
between these pathways could exist to coordinate the similar expression
patterns, which need to be further investigated (Fig. 6).

DCP-66 does not seem involved in the morphogenesis of the excre-
tory cell because loss of the gene did not cause the obvious morpholog-
ical changes in the cell (Fig. 4D). Neither pgp-3 nor pgp-12 are involved
in morphogenesis of the excretory cell. They are recently duplicated
ABC transporters and may be involved in xenobiotic resistance based
on their homologs in human (33). Similar functional annotation and
expression patterns between pgp-3 and pgp-12 suggest that the two
related genes are possibly subject to subfunctionalization that is often
seen in duplicated genes (34). nas-31 encodes an astacin-like protein
that might be involved in morphogenesis and pattern formation of
excretory cell (35).

DCP-66 was also found in vulvae, pharynx, and posterior neurons, in
addition to the excretory cell. Incomplete overlapping expression pat-
terns of dcp-66 and pgp-12 suggest its possible regulatory roles in mul-
tiple tissues. These roles are consistent with previous observations (18,
36). Because the excretory cell is a functional equivalent of vertebrate
kidney, the regulatory element and its binding factor identified here will
provide a new entry point into investigating mechanisms of kidney
development and its related diseases. pgp-12 is a member of the ABCB
subfamily of the ABC transporter genes in C. elegans whose homologs in
human are multiple drug resistance proteins (33). Identification of
pgp-12 regulators will provide insights into modulation of multiple drug
resistance that is a big challenge during chemotherapy.
