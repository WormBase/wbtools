Abstract

How a common neurotransmitter phenotype specified in neurons of different origins is an outstanding issue in neuronal development and
function. In C. elegans larvae, serotonin is synthesized in 2 pairs of neurons, the secretory neurons NSM and the chemosensory neurons ADF. In
order to delineate the molecular mechanisms of serotonergic phenotype establishment, we have screened for neuron-specific serotonin deficient
(nss) mutants. Our prior study showed that the POU-homeodomain factor UNC-86 is expressed in and required for the NSM neurons to adopt
serotonergic phenotype and correct pathfinding, whereas ADF are unaffected in unc-86-null mutants. Here, we report that the LIM-homeodomain
factor LIM-4 regulates ADF serotonergic phenotype. In lim-4 mutants, many aspects of ADF differentiation occur, however, they fail to express
serotonin phenotype and exhibit aberrant cilia properties. LIM-4 expression rises in the neuroblast that produces two distinct neurons: ADF and
the olfactory neuron AWB. We show that lim-4 is regulated by separable mechanisms to determine disparate subtype identities in these two
neuronal types. In vivo promoter analyses reveal that cis-element(s) within introns are necessary and sufficient to direct lim-4 to specify
serotonergic phenotype, whereas its 5V-upstream sequence directs lim-4 function in AWB. Thus, a transcription factor may act independently to
specify distinct differentiation traits in two sister cells. We propose that serotonergic identity is specified in cell-specific contexts to coordinate the
development and function.

Introduction

Neurotransmitters are vital agents for the function of neural
circuits, transducing external environmental cues detected by
sensory neurons to the CNS and ultimately to produce changes
in behavior and physiology. During neurogenesis, individual
neural lineages produce diverse neurons in a specific order,
each neuron with a unique assortment of cell
identities,
including cell body position, surface receptors, axonal trajec-
tory, synaptic connectivity and choice of neurotransmitters. The
temporal and spatial pattern of neuronal diversification is
highly reproducible within an organism, forming the funda-
mental matrix that allows dynamic environmental cues each
translated via a specific neurotransmitter pathway into a
particular perception (Udin and Fawcett, 1988; Lewin, 1994).

One intriguing phenomenon during neural patterning is the
development of neurotransmitter
identity—sister neurons
derived from a single cell division often express distinct
neurotransmitters, and, conversely, a variety of neuronal types
of different origins may adopt a common neurotransmitter.
Studies of neural development
in both vertebrates and
invertebrates have provided considerable insights into the
contribution of environmental signaling and lineage restrictions
in neurogenesis and have identified many extracellular
signaling factors and intracellular proteins that direct neuronal
diversity (Tanabe and Jessell, 1996; Shirasaki and Pfaff, 2002;
Brody and Odenwald, 2002; Lanjuin and Sengupta, 2004).
These studies suggest that sequential production of different
neuronal subtypes reflects temporal and spatial expression of
transcription factors in neural progenitors. It remains unclear,
however, how a common neurotransmitter is specified in
neurons of different lineages and whether the development of
transmitter phenotype is intimately linked to other aspects of
the neuronal identity.

The same set of genes is used to produce mature phenotypes
of a neurotransmitter in different neurons within an organism,
and these genes are extremely conserved across phyla.
Emerging evidences from both vertebrates and invertebrates
indicate that a common neurotransmitter phenotype may be
specified by different determinants in different neurons. For
example, in mammalian CNS, the rostral and caudal seroto-
nergic neurons arise from a similar origin but develop into
distinct projection patterns: the rostral neurons project to the
cortex and hypothalamus, and the caudal neurons project to the
spinal cord (Wallace and Lauder, 1992; Hynes and Rosenthal,
1999). The development of
rostral serotonergic neurons
requires Shh, FGF signaling and the homeobox gene Nkx2.2
(Ye et al., 1998; Briscoe et al., 1999; Pattyn et al., 2003), but
caudal serotonergic identity is dependent on the GATA-3
transcription factor (van Doorninck et al., 1999). However, the
ETS transcription factor PET-1 is expressed in both the rostral
and caudal serotonergic neurons and inactivation of the pet-1
gene results in 70% loss of rostral and caudal serotonergic
neurons (Hendricks et al., 2003; Scott et al., 2005). Because
missing any of these factors results in failure in generation or
premature degeneration of serotonergic neurons, these factors
may have broad functions in the development and survival of
the neurons. Neuron-type-specific determination of serotoner-
gic phenotype is further demonstrated in Drosophila lacking
the LIM-homeodomain transcription factor islet,
in which
neurons in the ventral nerve cord are generated and survive but
fail to produce serotonin, while the serotonergic neurons in the
CNS are unaffected (Thor and Thomas, 1997). However, islet
also regulates dopaminergic phenotype in ventral cord neurons;
it
is not clear how islet-expressing cells choose between
serotonin and dopamine.

role of

The potential

‘‘neuron-specific’’

regulation of
neurotransmitter phenotype may be gleaned from studies of
GABAergic phenotype in C. elegans. The homeobox gene
unc-30 activates the expression of genes essential for GABA
synthesis and release, and regulates the synaptic connectivity
specifically in the type D motor neurons that control C. elegans
locomotion (Jin et al., 1994; Eastman et al., 1999), whereas the
LIM-homeobox gene lim-6 coordinates GABAergic phenotype
and pathfinding of the DVB and AVL motor neurons that
regulate defecation behavior (Hobert et al., 1999). Coordinated
transcriptional regulation of neurotransmitter phenotype and
synaptic property may represent one principle in establishment
of
functional circuits and underlie the genetic bases of
behavioral modulation and, perhaps, behavioral disorders.

To begin to address this issue, we have undertaken genetic
dissection of serotonergic phenotype in C. elegans. In C.
elegans larvae, only 4 neurons, a pair of pharyngeal secretory
neurons NSM and a pair of chemosensory neurons ADF,
produce serotonin (Sze et al., 2002), providing a simple genetic
system in which to investigate the development of serotonergic
phenotype. Serotonin synthesis in C. elegans requires the tph-1
gene, which encodes a tryptophan hydroxylase that catalyzes
the rate-limiting first step of serotonin synthesis, and animals
bearing a tph-1 deletion mutation show no detectable serotonin
based on whole-mount staining with anti-serotonin antibodies

(Sze et al., 2000). In vivo promoter analyses have revealed that
tph-1 expression in the NSM and ADF neurons is regulated
independently via distinct cis-regulatory elements (Sze et al.,
2002), indicating that serotonergic phenotype in C. elegans
also is regulated by neuron-specific mechanisms.

To identify factors involved in neuron-specific regulation of
serotonin synthesis, we have conducted screens for mutants
with neuron-specific serotonin deficiency (nss). We have
reported that
the POU-homeodomain transcription factor
UNC-86 is expressed in the NSM neurons, and inactivation
of unc-86 abolishes tph-1 expression in NSM and affects their
pathfinding, but that the ADF neurons are unaffected in unc-
86-null mutants (Sze et al., 2002). Here, we describe genetic
and molecular characterization of
the LIM-homeodomain
transcription factor LIM-4 in the development of the seroto-
nergic neurons ADF. We show that LIM-4 is expressed in the
precursor neuroblast that produces two distinct neurons, ADF
and the olfactory neuron AWB, that LIM-4 is regulated by
distinct mechanisms to regulate distinct subtype identities of
ADF and AWB, and that this differential action is dictated by
cis-regulatory elements within the lim-4 gene. Thus, LIM-4
acts independently to specify distinct differentiation traits in
two sister cells and a multi-functional transcription factor could
function as a neuron-specific determinant of neurotransmitter
phenotype.

All

the constructs from this work were generated by PCR. For each
construct, products from at least two independent PCR reactions were pooled to
reduce potential PCR errors. The pooled PCR products were purified
(QIAquick, Qiagen) and microinjected at the concentration of 50 ng/Al into
worms. As indicated, the plasmid containing either a dominant rol-6 gene, rol-
6(d), or elt-20gfp (a gift from J. McGhee, University of Calgary, Canada) was
coinjected as a transgenic marker.

Isolation and characterization of yz3 and yz12 mutations

The yz3 and yz12 mutations were isolated based on reduction/absence of
GFP in the ADF neurons after ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis of WT
worms carrying yzIs71[tph-10gfp; rol-6(d)]. The mutagenesis and mutant
screens have been described previously (Sze et al., 2002). We screened through
6500 haploid genomes, and recovered 24 neuron-specific serotonin deficient
mutants (nss). We have reported that two of the nss genes, nss-2 and nss-3, are
alleles of the TRPV channel genes ocr-2 and osm-9, respectively, that act in the
ADF neurons to control serotonin synthesis (Zhang et al., 2004). Thus, this
screen recovers genes that regulate the development as well as the function of
the serotonergic neurons.

We mapped the yz12 mutation to the X chromosome between clones T06F4
and C02F12, using restriction enzyme site polymorphisms between N2 and the
Hawaiian C. elegans isolate CB4856 (Wicks et al., 2001). Complementation
assays indicated that yz12 and yz3 are allelic to lim-4(ky403). The molecular
lesion of the yz12 and yz3 mutations was determined by PCR amplification of
the exons and exon/intron boundaries from the mutant strains and sequencing
the PCR fragments.

Immunochemical analysis

The staining of anti-serotonin antibody was performed using the McIntire –
Horvitz whole-mount procedure (McIntire et al., 1992). To conduct anti-myc
antibody staining, animals were fixed according to an established protocol
(Finney and Ruvkun, 1990), and stained with monoclonal anti-myc antibody
(Clontech, 1:200 dilution). Antibody staining of embryos was conducted as
described (Guenther and Garriga, 1996). Anti-LIN-26 antibody was a gift from
Dr. M. Labouesse (IGMBC, France) and used at 1:100 dilution. The staining
patterns were visualized via Alexa Fluor 568 or 488 conjugated secondary
antibodies (Molecular Probe; 1:2000 dilution) under a Zeiss Axioplan II
fluorescence microscope equipped with proper filters.

Dye filling assays

The stock solution was 1 mg DiI/ml Dimethlyformamide and stored at
 20
-
C. The working solution was 1:1500 dilution of the DiI stock in M9
buffer. Well-fed animals were washed off from cultural plates, incubated in 1.5
ml of the DiI working solution at room temperature for 30 min, washed 3 times
with the M9 buffer, and observed under a fluorescence microscope.

Results

yz3 and yz12 mutations specifically disrupt serotonergic
phenotype in the pair of chemosensory neurons ADF

Serotonergic phenotype can be precisely identified within
the nervous system of the nematode C. elegans. Although
seven neurons from four neuronal classes can be stained by
antibodies raised against serotonin in a hermaphroditic larva
(Horvitz et al., 1982; Sze et al., 2000), two classes, ADF and
NSM, each consisting of
two bilaterally morphological
symmetric neurons (White et al., 1986), are capable of de
novo synthesis of serotonin. A pair of AIM and a single RIH

interneurons absorb extracellular serotonin via the membrane
serotonin transporter (SERT) (Sze et al., 2002; Dempsey and
Sze, unpublished) encoded by the mod-5 gene (Ranganathan et
al., 2001). The ADF and NSM neurons are generated from
different lineages during embryogenesis, each class mediating
specific behaviors: the ADF neurons sense external environ-
mental signals (Bargmann and Horvitz, 1991), and NSM are
involved in feeding behavior (Avery and Horvitz, 1989). In
addition, a pair of motor neurons HSN produces serotonin in
adulthood, and HSN modulate the rhythm of vulva muscle
contraction to release fertilized eggs (Desai et al., 1988).

The tph-1 gene encodes a tryptophan hydroxylase and is
required for serotonin synthesis in C. elegans (Sze et al., 2000).
Coincident with serotonin immunoreactivity, the expression of
a green fluorescent protein reporter (tph-10gfp) starts in the
ADF and NSM neurons upon the animal hatching to sense the
environment and feed, and in HSN only when the animal
begins to fertilize eggs, suggesting that
the serotonergic
phenotype is intimately linked to the functional status of
individual neuronal
to investigate how
specification of serotonergic phenotype integrates with the
development of other cellular identities, we used tph-10gfp as
a reporter and conducted visual screens for neuron-specific
serotonin deficient mutants. We reasoned that mutations
affecting a ‘‘master determinant’’ should abolish tph-1 expres-
sion in all the neurons, and that mutations in ‘‘neuron-specific
determinants’’ may affect particular neuronal classes.

types.

yz3 and yz12 (previously known as nss-1(yz12)) are two
mutations specifically affecting tph-10gfp expression in the
ADF neurons. In yz3 and yz12 mutants, tph-10gfp expression
in the ADF neurons is dramatically reduced or undetectable,
but the GFP level in the NSM and HSN neurons is unaffected
(Fig. 1a; Table 1). To determine the yz3 and yz12 mutations
indeed affecting serotonergic phenotype of the ADF neurons,
we stained mutants with anti-serotonin antibody. 100% of yz12
mutant and 57% of yz3 mutant animals show ADF serotonin
immunoreactivity reduced or abolished, but the other neurons
are stained normally (Fig. 1a, N = 100 for each strain). We
conclude that yz3 and yz12 mutations affect genes that are
necessary for ADF to produce serotonin.

yz3 and yz12 are two alleles of the LIM-homeodomain
transcription factor LIM-4

We mapped the yz3 and yz12 mutations to a small interval
on the X chromosome. Through complementation assays and
sequencing of the mutant genomic DNA, we find that yz3 and
yz12 are allelic to lim-4. The coding sequence predicts that the
lim-4 gene encodes a transcription factor with two metal-
binding, protein-interacting LIM-domains followed by a DNA-
binding homeodomain (Sagasti et al., 1999). yz12 is a 296-bp
deletion that removes the entire homeodomain and results in a
premature stop codon shortly after the deletion site, and yz3 is a
G to A transition that destroys the splice donor site of the fifth
intron and eliminates the coding sequence for a part of the
homeodomain (Fig. 1b). Three sets of additional experiments
further confirm that LIM-4 regulates tph-1 expression in the

(Table 1) and serotonin immunoreactivity in ADF (78%, N =
87). Second, a genomic fragment containing the WT lim-4
gene, lim-4(+), rescues ADF tph-1 expression and serotonin
immunoreactivity in yz12 mutant animals (Fig. 1a, Table 1).
Third, expression of a lim-4 genomic fragment containing the
LIM-domains alone, lim-4(DHD), impairs ADF serotonergic
phenotype in WT animals (Table 1).

These results indicate that the LIM-homeobox gene lim-4 is
required for tph-1 expression in the ADF neurons. All three lim-
4 mutations destroy the DNA-binding homeodomain, suggest-
ing that LIM-4 activates the expression of genes that produce
serotonergic phenotype in the ADF neurons. It has been
reported that LIM-domains function as adapter elements to
promote assembly of multi-protein complex or directly influ-
ence the affinity of its homeodomain to the target DNA (Xue et
al., 1992; Sanchez-Garcia et al., 1993; Lee and Pfaff, 2003). The
LIM domain of islet-3 has been shown to act as a specific
dominant-negative variant of islet-3 (Kikuchi et al., 1997). The
dominant-negative effect of the lim-4(DHD) transgene on tph-1
expression suggests that expression of the LIM domains alone
may either prevent the endogenous WT LIM-4 proteins from
binding to the target DNA, or they titrate out the activating
cofactors. Because the yz12 mutation that completely removes
the homeodomain does not completely eliminate tph-1 expres-

622

sion in the mutant animals (Table 1), LIM-4, instead of acting as
sole activator, is likely interacting with LIM-binding cofactors
to promote serotonergic phenotype in ADF.

The LIM-4 protein is expressed in the precursor of ADF

The expression pattern of lim-4 in larval and adult animals
has been examined with two GFP reporter constructs, and lim-
40gfp was not detected in the ADF neurons but
it was
detected in the olfactory neurons AWB, the sister cells of ADF
from the same precursor neuroblasts (Sagasti et al., 1999). It
has been shown that the mouse LIM-homeobox genes Lhx3
and Lhx4 are transiently expressed during mitotic division to
specify subclass identity of motor neurons (Sharma et al.,
1998). We reasoned that LIM-4 could act earlier to promote
asymmetric cell division producing AWB and ADF. Alterna-
tively, ADF serotonergic phenotype could be regulated by
signals from AWB. To test the first possibility, we determined
whether lim-4 is expressed in the ADF/AWB precursor cells.
To examine LIM-4 expression in embryos, we inserted a
myc epitope at the N-terminus of the LIM-4 coding region in
the context of the lim-4(+) construct and introduced this fusion
gene into yz12 mutants. This myc0lim-4 transgene potently

rescues ADF serotonergic phenotype in yz12 mutants (Table 1),
indicating that the MYC0LIM-4 protein is expressed in cells
necessary to specify ADF serotonergic identity. To examine
lim-4 expression during the embryogenesis, we stained the eggs
at various developing stages with anti-myc antibodies. We used
a GFP reporter for the GATA gene elt-2, which is specifically
expressed in the gut lineage (Fukushige et al., 1998), to stage
the embryos. MYC0LIM-4 immunoreactivity is first detected
in two cells approximately 160 min post-fertilization at 8 gut
nuclei stage (Fig. 2a). The pair of ADF and the pair of AWB
neurons are generated approximately 280 min post-fertilization
from two symmetrical
lineages descended from the AB
cell (Sulston et al., 1983; Fig. 3a). We identify the two
MYC0LIM-4-staining cells as the neuroblasts ABalpppppa
and ABpraaappa that respectively give rise to left/right ADF
and AWB neurons, based on triple labeling of the embryos
with antibodies raised against the LIN-26 protein (Labouesse
et al., 1996), which is expressed in the nuclei of
the
hypodermal cells that border the ADF/AWB mother cells
(Figs. 2c, d). Like lim-40gfp (Sagasti et al., 1999),
the
MYC0LIM-4 immunoreactivity is not detected in ADF at
any stage of larvae or adults, but it is observed in AWB and
several other neurons in the head throughout life (Fig. 2b,

Fig. 2. LIM-4 is expressed in the pair of neuroblasts that produce ADF. The animals are WT carrying three transgenes: integrated tph-10gfp is expressed in post-
embryonic serotonergic neurons, elt-20gfp is specifically expressed in the nuclei of gut cells (Fukushige et al., 1998) and serves as a marker for embryonic stages,
and myc0lim-4(+) has the myc epitope tagged to the N-terminus of the coding region of the WT lim-4 gene. (a) Images of WT embryos at the stage of 4 gut cells and
onwards. The embryos are triple-labeled with anti-myc antibody (red), elt-20gfp (green), and DAPI (blue). The top panel shows that myc immunoreactivity is first
detected in two cells around the stage of 8 gut cells. As the embryos developing additional cells also are stained, but we cannot determine if any of them are ADF.
The lower panel shows the merged images of anti-myc immunoreactivity, elt-20gfp expression with DAPI labeled nuclei. GFP was visualized with a FITC filter, and
the staining pattern of anti-myc antibodies was detected by Alexa fluor 568 conjugated anti-mouse antibodies, using a Rhodamine red filter. (b) WT animals double-
labeled with anti-myc antibody and tph-10gfp. MYC0LIM-4 (red) can be detected in the AWB neurons throughout life. However, we cannot observe myc
immunoreactivity overlapping with tph-10gfp (green) expression at any stage of the animals. A larval stage-4 animal is shown. Anterior is to the left. (c) A

amphid sensory neurons are sequentially generated from the lineage. (b) The lim-4 mutation is accompanied by reduction of tph-10gfp expression and ectopic dye

expressed in the dye filled ASK neurons, and gcy-80gfp and gcy-50gfp are specifically expressed respectively in non-dye filling AFD and ASE(R) neuron. The lim-
4(yz12) mutation does not alter the gene expression or dye filling in these neurons.

identify ADF neurons immediately following the postmitotic
division,
to determine if LIM-4 is excluded
from ADF or
there transiently. However,
neuron-specific rescue experiments show that expression of
LIM-4 in AWB is not sufficient to induce ADF serotonergic
phenotype, suggesting that the LIM-4 directly regulates ADF
development (see below). Our results are most consistent
with the scenario that LIM-4 specifies ADF serotonergic fate
either before the last cell division or at an early phase of the
postmitotic differentiation. The brief action of LIM-4 in
ADF differentiation may be mechanistically analogous to the
role of the transient expression of the mouse LIM-home-
odomain factor
Isl2 in subtype identity specification of
nascent motor neurons in the developing spinal cord (Thaler
et al., 2004).

LIM-4 regulates specific aspects of ADF identity

Does the absence of the lim-4 gene activity cause a
complete cell fate transformation, or the mutations specifically

prevent the ADF neurons from adopting serotonergic pheno-
type? To address this question, we have examined GFP
reporters for other ADF neuronal markers in the most severe
lim-4 allele, yz12. We first determine the effect of the yz12
mutation on the expression of other genes their products
involved in serotonergic phenotype. cat-4 encodes a GTP-
cyclohydrolase I, a cofactor of tryptophan hydroxylase, and is
required for serotonin biosynthesis. cat-1 encodes a vesicular
monoamine transporter (VMAT) that pumps serotonin into
synaptic vesicles for regulated exocytosis (Duerr et al., 1999).
We have shown in WT animals that both cat-40gfp and cat-
10gfp are strongly expressed in serotonergic neurons (Sze et
al., 2002). The yz12 mutation dramatically reduces or
eliminates the expression of both GFP reporters in the ADF
neurons (Table 2). Thus, LIM-4 is required for the expression
of genes involved in serotonin synthesis and release.

Another LIM-homeobox gene, lin-11, is expressed in the
ADF neurons (Freyd et al., 1990; Hobert et al., 1998). 75% of
yz12 animals contain no detectable lin-110gfp in ADF, and the
remaining yz12 animals express lin-110gfp in one ADF
neuron (Table 2). To determine if lin-11 acts downstream of

lin-110 gfp and cat-10gfp are integrated onto the chromosomes. The other
GFP reporters were carried as extra-chromosomal arrays, and transgenic
animals were scored. The definition for GFP intensity is as described in Table
1. Mixed stages animals from multiple generations were scored. N is the

et al., 1997).

lim-4 to specify ADF serotonergic phenotype, we crossed tph-
10gfp into lin-11 mutants. No reduction of
tph-10gfp
expression can be detected in lin-11(n566) mutants (N >
100), nor serotonin immunoreactivity is affected in lin-
11(n566) and lin-11-null n389 mutants (data not shown).

The ADF neurons are one of 12 classes of sensory neurons
that group together forming the major C. elegans sensory
organ, the amphid. These amphid sensory neurons share a
similar overt morphology. Every class consists of a bilaterally
symmetric pair of neurons, and each neuron extends a single
axon to the nerve ring and projects a single dendrite to the tip
of the nose (White et al., 1986). However, different neuronal
classes possess different properties at their ciliated sensory
endings, express different assortment of membrane receptors,
and sense different environmental cues (Ward et al., 1975;
Troemel et al., 1995; Lanjuin and Sengupta, 2004). When live
WT animals are bathed in a solution containing the
fluorescent dye DiI, six classes of
the amphid sensory
neurons are filled with the dye—AWB exhibit dye filling,
but ADF do not (Hedgecock et al., 1985). The dye enters the
neurons through their cilia (Perkins et al., 1986) and it has
been reported that lim-4 mutations alter AWB cilia structure
and prevent them from dye filling (Sagasti et al., 1999). By
contrast, we find that ADF neurons that exhibit significantly
reduced tph-10gfp expression become dye filled in lim-4
mutants (Fig. 3b). Judged by fluorescence microscopy, the
position and morphology of the cell body, and the trajectory
of the axon and dendrite are indistinguishable to that seen in
WT animals.

The srh-142 gene encodes a putative seven-transmembrane
chemoreceptor and is predominantly expressed only in the
ADF neurons, and this expression is not affected by lim-4
mutations (Sagasti et al., 1999). Consistent with this report, we

find that lim-4 mutations do not affect the expression level of
srh-1420gfp in the ADF neurons, although 69% of yz12
animals show GFP only in one ADF neuron (Table 2). Of ADF
neurons that express srh-1420gfp, 77% exhibit dye filling in
yz12 background (N = 44), but no ADF is filled with the dye in
WT animals (N > 100). Because tph-1 mutants that contain no
serotonin do not exhibit dye filling in ADF, lacking serotonin
per se is unlikely affecting the cilia property. Together, these
results indicate that the generic chemosensory neuronal fate
and some ADF-specific properties develop in the absence of
lim-4, and suggest that LIM-4 regulates genes whose products
are necessary for subsets of ADF identity, including expressing
serotonergic phenotype and formation of ADF-specific cilia.

LIM-4 is regulated by distinct mechanisms to specify distinct
subtype identities in two sister cells

Besides ADF and AWB, 4 other classes of the amphid
sensory neurons also are derived from the same lineage
(Sulston et al., 1983; Fig. 3a). Consistent with our observation
that the expression of LIM-4 begins in the ADF/AWB mother
cells (Fig. 2), lim-4 mutations do not have a detectable effect
on any other class of the neurons, based on the pattern of dye
filling and characteristic neuronal markers (Figs. 3c – f). These
results tend to suggest
that LIM-4 acts in the ADF/AWB
precursor to promote asymmetric cell division generating two
daughter cells with distinct differentiation fates. However, lim-
4 mutations do not prevent the last mitotic division because
cells corresponding to ADF and AWB are generated in lim-4
mutants (Sagasti et al., 1999; Table 2, Fig. 3). Furthermore, the
absence of LIM-4 does not cause two daughter cells to adopt an
identical cell fate. In lim-4 mutants, the AWB neurons lost dye
filling and become to express the olfactory neuron AWC
marker gene str-2 (Sagasti et al., 1999), whereas the ADF
neurons gain dye filling property but do not misexpress str-1
(Figs. 3b and c), str-2 (results not shown), or the markers for
several other ‘‘dye filling’’ chemosensory neurons (Figs. 3d – f;
results not shown), and ADF can still express their unique
sensory receptor srh-142 (Table 1).

is genetically separable.

We have tested whether the action of lim-4 in ADF and
It has been

reported that
the otx/otd homeodomain transcription factor
CEH-37 is required for lim-4 expression in AWB, and that ceh-
37 mutations affect AWB neuronal identity, very much like that
seen in lim-4 mutants (Lanjuin et al., 2003). We tested if
deletion of ceh-37 affects ADF serotonergic phenotype. There
is no significant difference detectable in the intensity of tph-
10gfp expression between WT (N = 20) and ceh-37(ok642)
mutant (N = 30) animals. Because every lim-4 mutation studied
affects tph-1 expression in ADF, we conclude that the function
of LIM-4 in specifying serotonergic phenotype is independent
of ceh-37 activity. This result suggests that
lim-4 can be
activated by factors other than CEH-37 to specify ADF
serotonergic identity.

To determine the molecular mechanisms underlying the
differential action of lim-4 in AWB and ADF, we tested
whether this differential transcriptional regulation of lim-4 is

dictated by cis-regulatory elements within the lim-4 gene. We
used a GFP reporter for the str-1 gene (str-10gfp) as a marker
for AWB, and tph-10gfp as a marker for ADF. In yz12
mutants, tph-10gfp expression in ADF and str-10gfp expres-
sion in AWB are reduced or absent (Figs. 4b, c). The lim-4(+)
transgene that contains 3.6 Kb 5V-upstream, exons, introns, and
1.5 Kb 3V-untranslated sequence of the lim-4 gene strongly
rescues the expression of both tph-10gfp (Figs. 1 and 4a) and
str-10gfp (data not shown),
this construct
contains the elements to direct lim-4 function in both ADF and
AWB. It has been reported that lim-4 cDNA when expressed in
AWB can rescue the str-10gfp expression (Sagasti et al.,
1999). To determine the cis-regulatory elements that direct lim-
4 action, we expressed the lim-4 cDNA under the control the
lim-4 5V-upstream sequence (Fig. 4a) and introduced this fusion
construct into yz12 mutant animals. The Plim-40lim-4(cDNA)
transgene, like lim-4(+), restores str-10gfp expression and dye
filling in AWB (Fig. 4c), supporting the published result.
However, unlike lim-4(+), Plim-40lim-4(cDNA) does not
rescue tph-10gfp expression in ADF (Figs. 4a, b).

indicating that

Sequences within introns have been shown to contain
regulatory elements to specify gene expression in both
vertebrates and invertebrates (Baumeister et al., 1996; Arnone
and Davidson, 1997; Levine and Tjian, 2003), including two C.
elegans LIM-homeobox genes, lin-11 and ttx-3 (Hobert et al.,

1998). We fused the genomic fragment encompassing the entire
lim-4 introns and exons to the basal promoter of an unrelated
gene, pes-10. This fusion construct strongly rescues ADF tph-
10gfp expression in yz12 mutants (Figs. 4a, b), but it does not
restore str-10gfp expression (comparing 93% of yz12 mutants
(N = 27) with 85% of yz12; Ppes-100lim-4 animals (N = 72)
missing str-10gfp expression). This result suggests that
sequences within the introns are necessary and sufficient to
direct lim-4 activity to specify ADF serotonergic identity.

The simplest explanation for these observations is that LIM-
4 participates in different transcriptional cascades to indepen-
dently regulate the differentiation of two sister cells: CEH-37,
directly or indirectly, activates the expression of lim-4 via the
5V-uncoding sequence to specify AWB identity, and that yet
unidentified transcription factor(s) bind to the elements in the
introns to activate lim-4 expression either before the last cell
division or in newly generated ADF to specify serotonergic
identity. Plim-40lim-4(cDNA) fully rescues AWB differentia-
tion but does not restore tph-10gfp expression, suggesting that
LIM-4 specifies ADF serotonin identity independent of AWB.

Discussion

Selection of a common neurotransmitter by diverse neuronal
types is a conserved mechanism for neuronal diversification in

Fig. 4. Distinct cis-regulatory elements direct lim-4 to specify distinct neuronal identity. (a) cis-elements within introns are essential for lim-4 to specify ADF
serotonergic identity. All the constructs carry the same 3V-UTR, each was introduced into yz12 mutants carrying integrated tph-10gfp. A plasmid containing elt-
20gfp was used as the transgenic marker for the lim-4 constructs. tph-10gfp expression in transgenic animals was scored. 2 – 3 transgenic lines for each construct
were analyzed, and the data represent the summary from at least 3 generations of the animals. The definition of GFP intensity is described in Table 1. N is the total
number of animals scored for each strain. (b) Fluorescence photomicrographs showing tph-10gfp expression in lim-4(yz12) mutants expressing WT lim-4 coding
regions under the control of different cis-regulatory sequences. (c) 5V-uncoding sequence directs lim-4 to specify AWB identities. In WT animals, str-10gfp and DiI
co-localize AWB. In yz12 mutant, str-1 expression is undetectable, and dye filling in AWB is dramatically reduced (as shown) or eliminated (see Fig. 3). Expression
of the lim-4 cDNA under the control of the lim-4 5V-uncoding sequence rescues str-10gfp expression and restores the dye filling.

nervous systems as divergent as worm, fly and man (Goridis
and Rohrer, 2002), allowing a small number of neurotransmit-
ter phenotypes subserving a wide spectrum of neuronal
circuits. In this study, we make the use of the unique ability
to observe identified serotonergic neurons in living C. elegans
animals and determine how serotonergic identity is specified in
different neuronal classes involved in distinct behaviors. The
genetic evidence generated from characterization of lim-4,
together with our previous studies (Sze et al., 2002), supports
the notion from Drosophila and mammalian systems that
serotonergic identity in different neurons are conferred by
different transcription factors and suggests a conservation of
molecular principles underlying serotonergic identity specifi-
cation. Neuron-specific regulation of serotonergic phenotype
may be potential targets for manipulation of serotonin signaling
in specific neural circuits.

A recurrent finding from our studies of neuron-specific
serotonin deficient mutants is that transcription factors that
regulate the development of serotonergic phenotype also
regulate the synaptic property. The ability of ADF to express
srh-1420gfp and the normal position and axonal projections
argue that the ADF neurons are generated and survive in lim-4
mutants. This suggests that
the unusual dye filling in the
mutant ADF is resulted from changes in the cilia property
rather than a complete cell fate transformation. Because tph-1
mutants that contain no detectable serotonin do not exhibit dye
filling in ADF, nor do mutants with compromised ADF cilia
show reduced serotonin synthesis (data not shown), thus it is
unlikely that serotonin per se controls the cilia property, or vice
versa. We have shown that null-mutations in unc-86 abolish
tph-1 expression and cause pathfinding defects in the NSM
neurons (Sze et al., 2000). These observations favor the idea
that the generic cell fates and cell surface receptors of the
serotonergic neurons are determined before or independent of
the commitment of serotonergic phenotype, and that LIM-4
and UNC-86 coordinately regulate serotonergic phenotype and
synaptic property in cell-specific context. Support to this idea is
the findings that the Drosophila LIM-homeodomain factor islet
coordinately regulates serotonergic phenotype and pathfinding
in the ventral nerve cord (Thor and Thomas, 1997), and LIM-
homeodomain factor LIM-6 and homeodomain factor UNC-30
regulate GABAergic phenotype and pathfinding of neurons
involved in particular behavior (Jin et al., 1994; Hobert et al.,
1999). Coordinated assignment of neurotransmitter phenotype
and synaptic property may represent one general mechanism to
build up functional neural circuits.

Our genetic evidence that LIM-4 regulates serotonergic
identity in C. elegans chemosensory neurons is consistent with
the role of LIM-homeodomain transcription factors in specifi-
cation of subtype neuronal identity during the development of
nervous systems in both vertebrates and invertebrates (Jessell,
2000; Hobert and Westphal, 2000; Shirasaki and Pfaff, 2002)
and LIM factors have been shown to regulate the development
of a number of neurotransmitter phenotypes (Zhao et al., 2003;
Simon et al., 2003). Previous studies have shown that in C.
elegans LIM-homeodomain transcription factors regulate
neuronal differentiation. mec-3 interacts with the POU-home-

odomain transcription factor UNC-86 and regulates the
development and function of mechanosensory neurons (Way
and Chalfie, 1988; Duggan et al., 1998). Unlike the role of lim-
4 in ADF and AWB, mec-3 mutations cause a complete cell-
fate transformation and the mechanosensory neurons are not
generated in the mutants (Way and Chalfie, 1988). ceh-14
appears to specifically regulate the cilia structure in the
thermosensory neurons AFD, as ceh-14-null mutations cause
defects in the cilia structure but do not have a detectable effect
on the expression of AFD marker genes (Cassata et al., 2000).
lin-11 functions broadly in both neuronal and non-neuronal
cells and regulates the development and/or function of these
cells (Freyd et al., 1987; Hobert et al., 1998; Newman et al.,
1999). A novel finding from our study is the distinct cis-
regulatory elements dictating lim-4 function in the ADF and
AWB neurons, demonstrating that LIM-4 independently
participates in the differentiation of two neuronal classes
generated from a single precursor neuroblast. Interestingly, it
has been shown that lin-11 also regulates the development of
two sister cells, AWA and ASG (Sarafi-Reinach et al., 2001),
but it has not yet been reported whether the expression of lin-11
is differentially regulated in these two neuronal classes. Cell-
specific cis enhancer elements are part of the evolutionary
conserved wiring system for a single transcription factor
participating diverse transcriptional regulatory cascades to
regulate different cellular identities (Baumeister et al., 1996;
Arnone and Davidson, 1997; Levine and Tjian, 2003). The
knowledge of cell-specific enhancers of development determi-
nants will help to elucidate their precise role in the develop-
ment of particular cellular identities.

lineage asymmetry.
Asymmetric allocation of cell fate determinants is a prime
mechanism for neuroblasts to generate daughter cells with
diverse cell fates (Hawkins and Garriga, 1998; Roegiers and
Jan, 2004). Some cell fate determinants are segregated to one
daughter cell during the cell division and others are selectively
activated in one daughter cell; these determinants act as a
binary switch and elimination of these gene activities causes
the daughter cell to adopt the cell fate of its sister (e.g., Numb
and Prospero, Spana et al., 1995) or of its mother cell (e.g.,
UNC-86, Finney et al., 1988). The immediate appearance of
LIM-4 expression pattern tends to suggest that LIM-4 also is an
asymmetric determinant that is inherited from the mother cell
to AWB. However, three lines of observations suggest that
LIM-4 independently regulates the development of
two
daughter cells. First, our studies, together with the previous
report (Sagasti et al., 1999), do not find lim-4 mutations
causing two daughter cells to resemble the fate of their mother
or to each other; instead, AWB adopt the fate of olfactory
neuron AWC (Sagasti et al., 1999) and ADF retain some of its
own identity. Second, lim-4 mutations affect distinct subclass
identities of ADF and AWB. Third, distinct cis-elements and
trans-regulators direct lim-4 function in ADF and AWB. The
homeobox gene ceh-37 specifically regulates lim-4 expression
in AWB, but it is not required for ADF to adopt serotonergic
transcription factors other than
identity. This suggests that

X. Zheng et al. / Developmental Biology 286 (2005) 618 – 628

627

CEH-37 must activate lim-4 to specify serotonergic identity.
Thus, LIM-4 is activated independently in different cellular
contexts to specify distinct differentiation traits of two neuronal
types resulted from a single precursor neuroblast. It will be
interesting to learn if this strategy is widely used for cell-
identity determinants to regulate daughter cell development.
