It is known that Yersinia pestis kills Caenorhabditis elegans by a
biofilm-dependent mechanism that is similar to the mechanism
used by the pathogen to block food intake in the flea vector.
Using Y. pestis KIM5, which lacks the genes that are required for
biofilm formation, we show that Y. pestis can kill C. elegans by a
biofilm-independent mechanism that correlates with the accumu-
lation of the pathogen in the intestine. We used this novel
Y. pestis–C. elegans pathogenesis system to show that previously
known and unknown virulence-related genes are required for full
virulence in C. elegans. Six Y. pestis mutants with insertions in
genes that are not related to virulence before were isolated using
C. elegans. One of the six mutants carried an insertion in a novel
virulence gene and showed significantly reduced virulence in a
mouse model of Y. pestis pathogenesis. Our results indicate that the
Y. pestis–C. elegans pathogenesis system that is described here can
be used to identify and study previously uncharacterized Y. pestis
gene products required for virulence in mammalian systems.

INTRODUCTION
The soil nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has been used as a model
to study the pathogenic mechanisms of several human
host
pathogens,
including Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria,
as well as fungal species (reviewed by Aballay & Ausubel, 2002;

Ewbank, 2002; Alegado et al, 2003; Nicholas & Hodgkin, 2004b;
Mylonakis & Aballay, 2005; Sifri et al, 2005). Recently, it was
reported that Yersinia spp kill C. elegans by a mechanism that
correlates with the formation of a biofilm in the head of the animals. It
was proposed that biofilm production, which requires the hmsHFRS
operon, prevents food intake and causes death by starvation (Darby
et al, 2002). To identify other virulence factors that are required
for the biofilm-mediated killing of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, the
virulence phenotype of 39 transposon insertion strains was studied
in C. elegans. Seven mutants in unknown genes and in genes
that encode factors involved in haemin storage and lipopoly-
saccharide biosynthesis were identified (Joshua et al, 2003). A later
report indicates that biofilm formation does not involve signalling
between Yersinia and C. elegans and that it depends on a continuous
exposure of the nematodes to Yersinia (Tan & Darby, 2004).

We sought

to develop a Yersinia pestis–C. elegans patho-
genesis model that aided identification and characterization of
virulence factors that are not necessarily related to biofilm
formation but are important for mammalian pathogenesis. Using
the Y. pestis strain KIM5, which lacks the hmsHFRS genes, and
standard conditions for C. elegans infection, we show here that
Y. pestis is able to cause a persistent and lethal intestinal infection
in nematodes. We also show that several genes that were
previously associated with virulence in other bacterial pathogens,
ompT, y3857 and yapH, are required for the full virulence of
Y. pestis in C. elegans. To identify previously undescribed
virulence factors, a Y. pestis EZHTN mutagenized library contain-
ing 984 clones was screened to identify insertion mutants that
show reduced virulence in nematodes. Two out of the six mutants
isolated on the basis of their reduced virulence in C. elegans
also showed reduced virulence in a mouse model of Y. pestis
pathogenesis. One of these mutants harbours an insertion in a
gene that has not been related to virulence before, the product of
which is similar to a putative exported protein of Salmonella
enterica serovar Typhi. These experiments show that C. elegans
can be used as an alternative model host
to accelerate the
identification and characterization of Y. pestis virulence factors
that are required for pathogenesis in mammalian systems.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Y. pestis kills C. elegans in a biofilm-independent manner
Y. pestis is the aetiological agent of bubonic plague, a zoonotic
is transmitted from natural animal reservoirs to
infection that
humans, usually through the bite of an infected flea.
In the
infected flea, the digestive tract is blocked by a Y. pestis biofilm
that is dependent on the same genes that are required for biofilm
formation on the surface of C. elegans (Darby et al, 2002). We
postulated that Y. pestis strains that are deficient
in biofilm
formation could enter the C. elegans intestine and eventually kill
the animals, by a mechanism that is different from blocking food
intake. As shown in Fig 1A, the nematodes died more quickly
when fed on the commonly studied Y. pestis KIM5 strain than
when fed on Escherichia coli OP50, the usual food source for
growing C. elegans in the laboratory. Although Y. pestis KIM5 kills
C. elegans more slowly than Y. pestis KIM6þ (Fig 1B), many other
human pathogens, including S. enterica, Enterococcus feacalis,
Serratia marcescens and Cryptococcus neoformans, also kill
nematodes with similar kinetics (Aballay et al, 2000; Labrousse
et al, 2000; Garsin et al, 2001; Mylonakis et al, 2002; Kurz et al,
2003). The time required for 50% of the nematodes to die (time to
death 50; TD50) when fed on a Y. pestis KIM5 lawn at 25 1C was
calculated in five independent experiments and was determined to
be 3.6370.27 days, whereas the TD50 was 9.5471.67 days when

fed on an E. coli OP50 lawn. The TD50 values of C. elegans
pathogens range from 4 h to 8 days, and almost half of the reported
TD50 values are as high as 3.63, or higher (reviewed by Sifri
et al, 2005). When eggs were placed on Y. pestis lawns, the animals
reached adulthood, which indicated that Y. pestis, in spite of its
virulence, supports nematode development and that nematode death
is not related to any deficiency in food intake (data not shown).

To test whether the premature death of the nematodes that were
infected with Y. pestis KIM5 correlates with the presence of bacteria
in the intestine, we infected the animals with Y. pestis KIM5
expressing the Aequiorea victoria green fluorescent protein (GFP).
Fig 1 shows that KIM5 is not capable of forming a biofilm on the
surface of
the
nematodes is distended and full of bacteria 48 h after initial expo-
sure to the pathogen. These results show that Y. pestis lacking the
hmsHFRS genes is still virulent in C. elegans and that virulence
factors other than those involved in biofilm formation can be studied
using the Y. pestis–C. elegans pathogenesis system described here.

Characterization of the Y. pestis infection of C. elegans
Previous work has shown that certain human pathogens can resist
the mechanical and humoral stresses of the C. elegans intestinal
environment and persistently colonize the gut (Aballay et al, 2000;

Fig 2 | Yersinia pestis persistently colonizes the Caenorhabditis elegans intestine. C. elegans N2 young adult animals were exposed to Y. pestis KIM5/
green fluorescent protein (GFP) (A,B) or Escherichia coli DH5a/GFP (C) for 24 h, transferred to E. coli OP50 for 24 h (A,C) or 48 h (B), and then
visualized using a Leica MZ FLIII fluorescence stereomicroscope. (D) Groups of 40 C. elegans N2 young adult animals were exposed for 6 h to Y. pestis
KIM5 (Po0.90) or E. coli OP50 (Po0.32), or for 24 h to Y. pestis KIM5 (Po0.001) or E. coli OP50, and then transferred to E. coli OP50. An arrow
points to the swollen tail of an animal infected with Y. pestis.

To determine whether Y. pestis KIM5 was capable of persistently
colonizing the C. elegans intestine, nematodes were fed on
Y. pestis KIM5/GFP for 24 h and then transferred to nonlabelled
E. coli. Fig 2 shows the presence of Y. pestis/GFP in representative
animals 24 h (panel A) or 48 h (panel B) after the animals were
transferred to E. coli, whereas E. coli/GFP was not observed
in a representative animal 24 h after the animal was transferred
to E. coli
(panel C). We also tested whether the persistent
colonization of the C. elegans intestine by Y. pestis correlated with
the killing of the animals. Using the transfer experiment described
above, we showed that nematodes exposed to Y. pestis KIM5
for 24 h died at the same rate as when they were continuously fed
on Y. pestis, whereas those transferred after an infection time
of only 6 h were rescued from a lethal infection (Fig 2D). These
results indicate that an initial infection period of 24 h is sufficient
for Y. pestis to establish a persistent colonization in C. elegans.

The presence of a swollen tail is a morphological phenotype
characteristic of nematodes that are infected with Y. pestis
(Figs 1F,2B). To our knowledge, the presence of a swollen tail
has not been previously reported in C. elegans infected with other
human pathogens, but it is very similar to that seen in animals that
are infected with a specific C. elegans pathogen, Microbacterium
nematophilum. These bacteria adhere to the anal region of the
nematodes and induce localized swelling of
the underlying

hypodermal tissue (Hodgkin et al, 2000). After initial characteri-
zation of this infection, it was found that the extracellular signal-
regulated kinase–mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK–MAPK)
signalling pathway mediates both tail swelling and a protective
response against M. nematophilum attack (Nicholas & Hodgkin,
2004a). It will be interesting to use the large collection of mutants in
the ERK–MAPK signalling pathway to determine whether a similar
C. elegans defence response is required to fight Y. pestis infection.

Known Y. pestis virulence factors in the killing of C. elegans
As many Y. pestis virulence determinants are encoded on
virulence plasmids, we decided to study the role of plasmids
pCD1 and pPCP1 on Y. pestis virulence in C. elegans. The pCD1
plasmid (also called pYV) encodes a type III secretion system
(TTSS) required for full virulence in mammalian systems, although
it is not sufficient to cause disease (Heesemann & Laufs, 1983;
Heesemann et al, 1984). The pPCP1 plasmid encodes the
plasminogen activator protease, which is important for dissemina-
tion of Y. pestis after subcutaneous injection into mammalian
hosts (Wren, 2003). To determine the importance of
these
plasmids in Y. pestis virulence in C. elegans, we compared the
susceptibility of the nematodes to strains cured of one or both
plasmids. Fig 3A shows that strains lacking one or two virulence
plasmids showed virulence that was comparable to that of

Y. pestis KIM5, which carries both virulence plasmids. These
results show that virulence factors encoded in pCD1 and pPCP1
are not required for Y. pestis virulence in C. elegans.

In addition to plasmid-encoded virulence factors, several
chromosomally encoded virulence factors have been identified
in Y. pestis, including genes encoding a potential second TTSS
(Revell & Miller, 2001). As shown in Fig 3B, at least three Y. pestis
KIM5 deletion mutants in chromosomally encoded genes pre-
sumably related to virulence (ompT, y3857 and yapH) that were
available in our stock showed reduced virulence in nematodes.
ompT encodes a member of the omptin family of outer-membrane
proteases, which have been implicated in the virulence of E. coli,
S. enterica, Shigella flexneri and Y. pestis virulence (Kukkonen &
Korhonen, 2004). y3857 encodes a putative exported metallo-
protease that shows significant amino-acid sequence similarity to
virulence-related metalloproteases from Yersinia ruckeri, Photo-
rhabdus luminescens, S. marcescens and Proteus mirabilis (Walker
et al, 1999; Fernandez et al, 2002; Bowen et al, 2003). The yapH
gene encodes a putative autotransporter adhesion protein; the
importance of this family of proteins in bacterial attachment to
the surface of host cells and protection from complement and
antimicrobial peptides has been studied in several species
(Roggenkamp et al, 2003; Rose et al, 2003; Wehrl et al, 2004).

Identification of novel mammalian virulence factors
To identify novel Y. pestis virulence factors, an EZHTN insertion
library containing 984 Y. pestis clones was screened, as described
previously (Tenor et al, 2004), for mutants that failed to kill or
showed attenuated killing of C. elegans. Six out of 984 insertion
mutants were identified on the basis of their slower killing of
C. elegans than the killing by wild-type Y. pestis KIM5. The
molecular characterization of the isolated strains indicates that all
the mutations are in genes that have previously not been
implicated in Y. pestis virulence. Three of the insertions, however,
are in genes that are related to virulence in other species (Table I).
To determine whether Y. pestis virulence-related genes
identified using C. elegans as a host have a role in mammalian
pathogenesis, we used an intranasal mouse model of Y. pestis
pathogenesis (supplementary information online)
to study the
virulence phenotypes of four isolated mutants. Using Y. pestis
KIM5, we found that the medial lethal dose (MLD or LD50) is
about 105 CFU. After intranasal inoculation of 10 LD50, bacteria
are present in the lungs at relatively low numbers for several days,
but the lung infection is often cleared by days 4–6. Histology on
days 3 and 4 after intranasal inoculation shows micro-abscesses in

the spleen and liver. These abscesses enlarge,
leading to the
complete destruction of the spleen architecture in some mice by
days 6–8 (Fig 4). Although the route of infection is the lungs, this
model
is more representative of septicemic than of human
pneumonic plague. Fig 4 shows the virulence phenotypes of two
mutants with reduced virulence both in the C. elegans model and in
the mouse model of Y. pestis pathogenesis. The virulence phenotype

of Y. pestis 9F11 is provided as an example of a mutant in a gene
that is probably required for full virulence in C. elegans but not in
mammals. The reduced virulence of Y. pestis KIM10 indicates that
the intranasal inoculation of bacteria alone does not cause lethality.
In summary, two out of the four mutants that were studied in
the mouse model showed a statistically significant attenuation in
virulence. The attenuated virulence shown by Y. pestis 5G5 is not
surprising, as y1021 encodes a cytochrome subunit previously
implicated in S. enterica virulence (Turner et al, 2003). The
reduced virulence of Y. pestis 5B9 is interesting because y0340

has not previously been related to virulence and its product is
a member of an uncharacterized family of putative exported
proteins that are found exclusively in several pathogens in the
family Enterobacteriaceae. Y. pestis KIM5 encodes seven indivi-
dual orthologues of the y0340 gene product in its chromosome. In
fact, y0340 is the last gene in an operon encoding three of the
seven Y0340 orthologues. The gene downstream of y0340 is
predicted to be transcribed in the opposite direction of y0340,
making the possibility of a polar effect due to the mutation highly
unlikely. These results show that C. elegans can be used as an
alternative model host to accelerate the identification and charac-
terization of Y. pestis virulence factors required for pathogenesis in
mammalian systems.

It

Concluding remarks
One drawback of using C. elegans to model bacterial pathogen-
esis is the fact that the nematode is grown at temperatures below
25 1C.
is well established that exposure to temperatures of
around 37 1C in the mammalian hosts results in the upregulation
of a range of Y. pestis virulence factors. In contrast, other Yersinia
virulence factors, such as invasin, and the Y. enterocolitica
chromosomal YSA TTSS are preferentially expressed at 26 1C
(Revell & Miller, 2001). In addition, Y. pestis virulence factors that
are required for colonization of the flea are optimally expressed at
lower temperatures. For example, the plasmid pMT1-encoded
Ymt protein, which has phospholipase D activity, is preferentially
expressed at 26 1C and has an important role in enabling infection
of the flea (Hinnebusch et al, 2002).

Soon after being injected by the flea, Y. pestis has to deal with
mammalian defences; therefore, the bacterium probably has to
express proteins that are required for defence against many mam-
malian innate defences at 25 1C. For example, Y. pestis is consti-
tutively serum resistant, whereas, in the enteropathogenic Yersiniae,
serum resistance is expressed only at 37 1C. This could also be
required owing the presence of serum-like products in the flea
gut. Thus, although temperature is a limitation, we theorized that
C. elegans could be useful for studying virulence factors that are

optimally expressed at 25 1C or constitutively expressed at both 25
and 37 1C. In spite of the long evolutionary distance and differences
in growth temperatures between nematodes and mammals,
the
results reported here show that C. elegans can be used as an alter-
native host to study Y. pestis virulence factors that are required for
pathogenesis in mammalian systems. These types of virulence factor
expressed at low temperatures may be required to regulate innate
immunity pathways conserved in nematodes, fleas and mammals.

METHODS
Bacterial strains and growth conditions. E. coli OP50 (Brenner,
1974), Y. pestis pgm  strains KIM5, KIM6, KIM8 and KIM10 (Une &
Brubaker, 1984) and Y. pestis pgmþ strain KIM6þ (Perry et al, 1990)
have been described previously. Y. pestis KIM5DompT, Y. pestis
KIM5DyapH and Y. pestis KIM5Dy3857 were generated using the
phage lambda Red recombinase method (Datsenko & Wanner, 2000),
essentially as described previously (Jackson et al, 2004).
Statistical analyses. Animal survival was plotted using the PRISM
(version 4.00) computer program. Survival curves are considered
significantly different from the control when P-values are o0.05.
Prism uses the product
limit or the Kaplan–Meier method to
calculate survival
fractions and the log-rank test, which is
equivalent to the Mantel–Heanszel test, to compare survival curves.
