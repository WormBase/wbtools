Among the 16 known vertebrate synaptotagmins, only
Syt I, IV and VII are also present in C. elegans and
Drosophila, suggesting that
these isoforms play
especially important roles in vivo. Extensive evidence
indicates that Syt I is a synaptic vesicle Ca2C
sensor
essential for rapid neurotransmitter release. It has been
suggested that the ubiquitously expressed Syt VII also
regulates synaptic vesicle exocytosis, despite its
presence in several tissues in addition to the brain.
Here, we discuss recent genetic and biochemical
evidence that does not support this view. Syt VII null
mutants do not have a neurological phenotype, and the
protein is found on the membrane of lysosomes and
some non-synaptic secretory granules, where it regu-
lates Ca2C
-triggered exocytosis and plasma membrane
repair.

Introduction
Synaptotagmins are a family of transmembrane proteins
thought to function as transducers of Ca2C
signaling in
membrane fusion events. All members of the synaptotag-
min gene family span membranes once, have short
lumenal domains and long cytoplasmic regions containing
two C2 domains connected by a short linker (Figure 1).
The tandem C2 domains of synaptotagmins, ﬁrst ident-
iﬁed in the synaptic vesicle isoform synaptotagmin I
(Syt I) [1], are homologous to the regulatory C2 region that
confers Ca2C
and phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) binding
activity to some isoforms of protein kinase C (PKC) [2,3].
Both the C2A and C2B domains of synaptotagmins have
an independently folding, compact b-sandwich structure
formed by two four-stranded b-sheets. Conserved acidic
residues (Asp) in ﬂexible loops within the C2 domains are
thought to play crucial roles in coordinating Ca2C
ions.
Differences have been found, however, in the shape of the
Ca2C
-binding pockets, in the electrostatic surface poten-
tial and the stoichiometry of bound Ca2C
ions for the two
domains. Syt I, the most extensively studied isoform to
date, appears to bind three Ca2C
ions through its C2A
domain, and two through its C2B domain [4–7].

Although detailed analysis has not yet been per-
formed with all isoforms, recent studies indicate that

synaptotagmins I, II, III, V, VI, VII, IX and X (but not IV)
bind to PtdSer-containing membranes as a function of
Ca2C
concentration [8–10]. As Syt I, IV and VII are the
only highly conserved synaptotagmin isoforms [11], Syt I
and Syt VII are the most likely to be involved in key,
evolutionarily conserved Ca2C
-dependent membrane
fusion events. A large amount of information is available
on Syt I, which is thought to function as a Ca2C
sensor for
synaptic vesicle exocytosis in neuronal cells. Here, we
discuss recent evidence indicating that Syt VII has a
distinct and more ubiquitous role, coupling Ca2C
signals
to the exocytosis of lysosomes and of certain secretory
granules.

sensors of different afﬁnities,

Syt I and Syt VII: Ca2C
controlling different exocytic events
Syt I is predominantly expressed in neuronal tissues,
where it is found on the surface of synaptic vesicles [12].
The C2A and C2B domains of Syt I mediate binding to
Ca2C
and PtdSer-containing membranes [13,14] and
insert rapidly into membranes in response to Ca2C
[7,15].
The extensive genetic and biochemical evidence indicating
that Syt I functions as a Ca2C
sensor for fast, synchronous
synaptic vesicle exocytosis has been the subject of
excellent recent reviews [7,15–17]. In an important recent
advance, in vitro reconstitution experiments have directly
demonstrated that Syt I couples Ca2C
signals to
membrane fusion events mediated by SNAREs (soluble
N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein
receptors) [18]. Addition of the cytoplasmic domain of
Syt I (containing the C2A and C2B domains) to proteolipo-
somes containing either the v-SNARE synaptobrevin or
the t-SNAREs syntaxin and SNAP-25, components of the
synaptic vesicle fusion machinery, markedly enhances
fusion in a Ca2C
-dependent fashion (see Figure 2 for a
model of SNARE–synaptotagmin interactions during
Ca2C
-triggered exocytosis). Importantly, fusion enhance-
ment was completely abolished when mutations predicted
to abolish Ca2C
binding activity were introduced into the
C2 domains [18]. Although fusion occurred much slower
than the millisecond timescale normally observed in
synaptic transmission, these results strongly suggest
that, in the absence of any additional proteins, Syt I is
the component that confers Ca2C
-sensitivity to SNARE-
mediated membrane fusion.

activated at lower Ca2C
concentrations than Syt I.
Furthermore, the disassembly kinetics of Ca2C
–Syt-VII–
membrane complexes is much slower than the kinetics
observed for equivalent complexes containing Syt I [8].
As discussed below, recent ﬁndings have conﬁrmed
that Syt VII is localized on a distinct set of vesicles,
where it regulates exocytosis triggered in the low-
micromolar Ca2C

range.

The ubiquitous Syt VII: lysosomes and non-synaptic
secretory granules
Unlike Syt I, which is localized on the membrane of
synaptic vesicles and expressed predominantly in the
nervous system, Syt VII has a broad tissue distribution. In
rat tissues, Syt VII is expressed in the brain, cerebellum
and olfactory bulb, intestine, kidneys, pancreas, heart,
lung and spleen [21], with high mRNA levels detected in
the brain and spinal cord, and uniform lower levels in
several other non-neuronal tissues [22]. Alternatively
spliced isoforms of Syt VII are expressed in the brain
[23,24], but most tissues express predominantly the
65-kDa major isoform, Syt VIIa [25].

The subcellular localization of Syt VII on lysosomes was
initially demonstrated in rat NRK cells [26] (Figure 3a),
and later conﬁrmed in human HEK293, mouse 3T3 and
hamster CHO cells [27]. In addition to lysosomes,
endogenous Syt VII was also detected on insulin-secreting
granules of pancreatic b-cells [28]. This localization is
largely consistent with the expression pattern of GFP
chimeras, which revealed Syt VII targeting to lysosomes
in ﬁbroblasts [26,29,30] (Figure 3b) and to both lysosomes
and large dense-core vesicles (LDCVs) in PC12 cells [31]
(M. Chicka and E.R. Chapman, unpublished). By contrast,
Syt VII was not detected in synaptic-like microvesicles of
PC12 cells [25]. Thus, the vast majority of studies indicate
that Syt VII is a ubiquitously expressed vesicular protein,

Synaptotagmins are transmembrane proteins, with a short N-terminal lumenal
domain and a large cytosolic region containing the tandem Ca2C
-binding C2
domains. The C2A and C2B domains are responsible for the Ca2C
-dependent
interactions with t-SNAREs and phospholipids, which are thought to be essential
for the regulation of exocytosis.

The proposed role of Syt I as a sensor coupling Ca2C
signals to membrane fusion raises the possibility that
additional
isoforms, which contain very similar C2
domains, play a similar role. The intrinsic afﬁnity of
Syt I for Ca2C
is low [6,19] but increases signiﬁcantly
when the C2 domains are bound to Ca2C
-dependent
ligands such as phospholipids [7,15]. Interestingly,

tration dependence was also reported for Syt VII C2A
binding to syntaxin [21], suggesting that Syt VII is

binding induces the association of synaptotagmin C2 domains with plasma membrane
phospholipids and SNARE molecules. Synaptotagmin C2 domains penetrate the membrane bilayer and SNARE four-helix bundles form, driving the formation of a fusion
pore. Ca2C
-induced oligomers of synaptotagmin might restrict the expansion of fusion pores (for clarity, only two synaptotagmin molecules are shown). Syt I, the
synaptotagmin isoform involved in synaptic vesicle exocytosis, interacts with the v-SNARE synaptobrevin and with the plasma membrane t-SNARES syntaxin 1 and SNAP-25
[7]. Syt VII, the synaptotagmin isoform regulating lysosomal exocytosis, interacts with the v-SNARE VAMP7 and with the t-SNARES syntaxin 4 and SNAP-23 [46].

found on lysosomes of nonspecialized cells (Figure 3) and
on lysosomes and secretory granules in some specialized
secretory cells.

For all vesicle types where Syt VII has been localized,
there is functional evidence for its involvement in the
regulation of Ca2C
-triggered exocytosis of these vesicles.
Secretion is inhibited when recombinant peptides corre-
sponding to the C2 domains of Syt VII are introduced into
permeabilized pancreatic b-cells [32] or PC12 cells [20].
Although endogenous Syt VII appears to be present at
very low levels in PC12 cells [33,34], LDCV exocytosis is
enhanced by Syt-VII–GFP expression and inhibited when
a speciﬁc siRNA is used to knock-down Syt-VII–GFP [31].
Ca2C
-triggered lysosomal exocytosis is inhibited in the
presence of Syt VII C2A domain peptides [26,35] and in
cells from Syt-VII-deﬁcient mice [36,37].

Does Syt VII also regulate synaptic vesicle exocytosis in
nerve terminals?
In addition to the studies described above, which detected
Syt VII on the membrane of lysosomes and of non-synaptic
secretory granules, one report proposed that it is
concentrated in presynaptic active zones of central
synapses and targeted to the plasma membrane of PC12
cells and hippocampal neurons [24,38]. However, as
discussed above,
in stable
PC12 transfectants, Syt VII is targeted to lysosomes and
LDCVs [31] (M. Chicka and E.R. Chapman, unpublished)
and not to the plasma membrane. In another recent study,

later studies showed that,

www.sciencedirect.com

immunoreactivity of ECFP–Syt-VII expressed in hippo-
campal neurons was detected by electron microscopy
mostly on interior membranes of nerve terminals [39].
Thus, a plasma membrane localization of Syt VII is not
supported by most of the available evidence. Given the
absence of Syt VII from synaptic vesicle-enriched fractions
in mice [24] and ﬂies [40], a functional role for Syt VII in
synaptic vesicle exocytosis would require a plasma
membrane localization. This brings us to the question: is
there any evidence that Syt VII regulates synaptic vesicle
fusion in vivo?

Genetic evidence addressing this question is now
available in mice [36] and Drosophila [40]. Syt-VII-
deﬁcient mice are viable, have histologically normal
brains and no evident neurological phenotype [36]. When
tested in Pavlovian contextual fear conditioning tests

mice was indistinguishable from that of Syt VII
(S. Chakrabarti, N.W. Andrews and M. Picciotto, unpub-
lished). These ﬁndings, which imply normal amygdala and
hippocampal
learning and memory function, argue
against Syt VII having an essential role in synaptic
neurotransmission. However, it cannot be ruled out that
more detailed analysis might uncover more subtle defects,
perhaps consistent with previous suggestions that Syt VII
might function as a high-afﬁnity Ca2C
sensor for the slow,
asynchronous form of synaptic vesicle fusion [20]. Recent
observations in ﬂies, however, argue against this

possibility. Immunolocalization with speciﬁc antibodies
revealed that Syt VII does not colocalize with Syt I on
Drosophila synapses. Rather, Syt VII is uniformly
distributed in neuronal cell bodies, in a punctate/vesicular
intracellular pattern that is also seen in muscle and
imaginal disks [40] (Figure 3c). Consistent with these
observations, Syt VII mRNA was detected not only in the
Drosophila central nervous system but also in several
non-neuronal tissues. Syt VII overexpression did not
rescue synaptic transmission and behavioral defects of
Syt I mutants [40], suggesting that Syt-VII-deﬁcient ﬂies
are also not likely to show neuronal abnormalities. In
future studies, it will be of interest to determine whether
the ubiquitous, vesicular distribution of Drosophila
synaptotagmin VII can be attributed to a lysosomal
localization, as shown in mammalian cells [26].

Syt VII and the regulation of lysosome-mediated
membrane repair
The realization that Ca2C
inﬂux triggers the exocytosis of
conventional lysosomes in many cell types [41] raised the
possibility that lysosomes might correspond to the Ca2C
-
dependent exocytotic vesicles shown previously to mediate
plasma membrane repair [42,26,41]. When ﬁbroblasts
were microinjected with Syt VII C2 domain peptides
[35,43] or antibodies against these domains [35], resealing
of the puncture wound was impaired [35,43] and a marked
reduction in cell viability was observed [35]. The same was
demonstrated using a model
for plasma membrane
wounding under physiological conditions. The resealing
of ﬁbroblasts wounded during the contraction of collagen
matrices, a process previously shown to be Ca2C
depen-
dent [44], was inhibited in the presence of Syt VII C2A
peptides [35] or after genetic ablation of Syt VII [36]. A
role for lysosomes in plasma membrane repair was
independently conﬁrmed in experiments targeting mol-
ecules distinct from Syt VII. Impaired resealing was
observed in cells microinjected with antibodies against the
cytosolic tail of the major lysosomal glycoprotein Lamp-1
[35], and resealing and viability defects were observed in
wounded Chediak Higashi/Beige ﬁbroblasts, which have
abnormally enlarged lysosomes owing to mutations in a
large cytosolic protein of unknown function, LYST [45].
Taken together, these results provide functional evidence
that Syt VII is a lysosomal membrane protein involved in
the regulation of exocytosis-mediated repair.

Similar to what has been demonstrated for Syt I, the
regulation of exocytosis by Syt VII appears to involve
speciﬁc SNARE complex interactions. Speciﬁc inter-
actions were detected between Syt VII, the lysosomal
v-SNARE VAMP7 and the plasma membrane t-SNAREs
syntaxin 4 and SNAP-23. In addition, functional inhi-
bition of
lysosomal exocytosis was observed in the
presence of inhibitory fragments of VAMP7 and syntaxin
4 and after cleavage of the t-SNARE SNAP-23 with
botulinum neurotoxin E [46].

Defects in lysosomal exocytosis and plasma membrane
resealing are also observed in murine embryonic ﬁbro-
blasts (MEFs) from Syt-VII-deﬁcient mice [36]. Despite
the absence of neurological abnormalities, these animals
develop a pathology resembling the human autoimmune

www.sciencedirect.com

diseases polymyositis and dermatomyositis. Inﬂammatory
inﬁltrates are detected a few weeks after birth in the skin
and skeletal muscle, a process that leads to focal
destruction of muscle ﬁbers, with extensive ﬁbrosis, loss
of muscle strength and production of anti-nuclear anti-
bodies [36]. It is intriguing that the inﬂammatory process
in Syt-VII-deﬁcient mice appears to be restricted to the
skin and skeletal muscle, two tissues under considerable
mechanical stress. It is known that the plasma membrane
of skeletal muscle ﬁbers is particularly susceptible to
injury during exercise [47]. Interestingly, dysferlin-
deﬁcient mice develop a form of muscular dystrophy that
has also been attributed to a defect in membrane repair
[48]. Dysferlin is a membrane protein that cycles between
intracellular vesicles and the sarcolemma, and which,
remarkably, contains six C2 domains similar to the Ca2C
-
binding domains of synaptotagmins [49]. Additional work
is now required to deﬁne the nature of the vesicles
carrying dysferlin within muscle ﬁbers and to determine
whether the C2 domains of dysferlin also have a Ca2C
sensing role in exocytosis and in membrane repair.

imaging of Ca2C

Synaptotagmins and the control of fusion pore
expansion
Several recent studies revealed that partial, ‘kiss-and-run’
exocytosis is a widespread phenomenon, detectable in
several different Ca2C
-regulated secretory cells [50–55].
In an exciting recent development, evidence has emerged
suggesting that Syt VII plays a crucial role in fusion pore
expansion during Ca2C
-triggered lysosomal exocytosis
-triggered lysosomal
[56]. Live-cell
revealed striking differences between
exocytosis
C/C
and Syt VII
MEFs. In wild-type cells,
Syt VII
approximately two-thirds of the fusion events triggered by
Ca2C
ionophore treatment were partial, with fusion pore
inner diameters restricted to less than 30 nm. This
pattern was markedly altered in Syt-VII-deﬁcient MEFs:
in these cells, most lysosomes merged completely with the
plasma membrane, with a markedly faster release of their
lumenal content [56]. These ﬁndings are consistent with
participation of Syt VII in the expansion of fusion pores, a
role also suggested by previous studies with other
synaptotagmin isoforms. Overexpression of Syt I in
PC12 cells slowed down the expansion of fusion pores,
whereas upregulation of Syt IV (a synaptotagmin isoform
devoid of Ca2C
-dependent phospholipid binding activity
[8]) appeared to have the opposite effect, shortening the
time from fusion pore opening to dilation [57]. These are
intriguing observations, considering the signiﬁcant
amount of evidence indicating that Syt I and Syt VII
undergo Ca2C
-dependent oligomerization [58–60], an
event thought to be important as a coupling step in
exocytosis [7]. The mechanism by which synaptotagmin
oligomerization regulates exocytosis is still not under-
stood, but it has been suggested that the assembly of
oligomers might cause structural rearrangements within
SNARE fusion complexes, affecting the time to opening or
the dilation kinetics of fusion pores [57]. In this context, it
is interesting to note that Syt VII appears to have unique
oligomerization properties, with the Ca2C
-binding loops of
its two C2 domains acting cooperatively to mediate robust

self-oligomerization [61]. These properties suggest that
Syt VII might be an ideal synaptotagmin isoform to
investigate the physiological role of Ca2C
-dependent
oligomerization. In future studies, it will be of great
interest to determine whether oligomers are formed when
Syt VII binds to target membranes in response to Ca2C
and whether these oligomers are directly involved in
restricting expansion of fusion pores.

and Syt VII

Despite the shift in fusion pattern, the extent of
lysosomal exocytosis is reduced in Syt-VII-deﬁcient
ﬁbroblasts stimulated with receptor-mediated Ca2C
ago-
nists or by mechanical wounding of the plasma membrane
[36,37,56]. By contrast, when cells are stimulated with a
Ca2C
ionophore, similar numbers of total fusion events are
MEFs [56]. This
observed in Syt VII
discrepancy reinforces the view that the results of
exocytosis assays involving ionophore stimulation should
be interpreted with caution. In addition to irreversible
damaging effects on the cytoskeleton, Ca2C
ionophores
cause a sharp decline in the ATP content of cells, owing to
dissipation of mitochondrial proton gradients and
increased activity of the plasma membrane Ca2C
ATPase
[62]. This ATP-depletion effect is likely to be responsible
for the relatively slow onset of lysosomal exocytosis
observed in ﬁbroblasts exposed to Ca2C
ionophores
[30,56], when compared with the kinetics of exocytosis-
mediated wound resealing [44,63].

Concluding remarks
Syt I and Syt VII are evolutionarily conserved members of
the synaptotagmin family. Both are localized on intra-
cellular vesicles and bind phospholipids and SNAREs as a
function of Ca2C
concentration. Although these properties
make Syt I and Syt VII strong candidates for functioning
as Ca2C
sensors in the regulation of exocytosis, their
different localization and apparent Ca2C
afﬁnities indicate
that they control very distinct membrane fusion events.
Earlier suggestions of a role for Syt VII as a plasma
membrane Ca2C
sensor, working in concert with Syt I in
regulating synaptic vesicle exocytosis, have not been
conﬁrmed. By contrast, what has emerged is that
Syt VII functions as a high-afﬁnity vesicular Ca2C
sensor
for the exocytosis of
lysosomes and other secretory
granules outside of the central nervous system.

The conservation of Syt VII expression in lower
eukaryotic organisms reinforces the view that exocytosis
controlled by this ubiquitous synaptotagmin has import-
ant roles in cell function and survival. The available data
already strongly indicate a requirement for Syt VII in
lysosome-mediated plasma membrane repair and in the
secretion of crucial mediators such as insulin. The
challenge now is to achieve a more detailed understanding
of the mechanism by which Syt VII promotes Ca2C
-
dependent, SNARE-mediated fusion and of how its unique
oligomerization properties inﬂuence the expansion of
fusion pores.
