Proteins That Fuse and Fragment Mitochondria in Apoptosis:
Con-Fissing a Deadly Con-Fusion?

Luca Scorrano1

During apoptosis, mitochondria undergo multiple changes that culminate in the release of cytochrome
c and other proapoptotic cofactors. Recently, a role for previously overlooked morphological changes,
ﬁssion of the mitochondrial reticulum and remodeling of mitochondrial cristae, has been suggested
in mammalian cells and in developmental apoptosis of C. elegans. Mitochondrial morphology is
determined by fusion and ﬁssion processes, controlled by a growing set of “mitochondria-shaping”
proteins, whose levels and function appear to regulate the mitochondrial pathways of cell death.
Expression of pro-fusion proteins, as well as of inhibition of pro-ﬁssion molecules reduces apoptosis,
suggesting a linear relationship between fragmentation and death. Mechanisms by which mitochon-
drial fragmentation promotes apoptosis and interactions between fragmentation and remodeling of
the inner membrane are largely unclear. A tempting, unifying hypothesis suggests that ﬁssion is
coupled to cristae remodeling to maximize cytochrome c release.

Mitochondria are crucial organelles for life and death
of the cell. They produce most of the ATP needed for en-
doergonic processes and are strategically located at the
sites of greater energy demand. They modulate cytoso-
lic Ca2+
transients, hence regulating complex signaling
processes (Duchen, 2000; Orrenius et al., 2003; Rizzuto
et al., 2000). The discovery by Korsmeyer and coworkers
that the antiapoptotic oncogene BCL-2 targets its prod-
uct to mitochondria (Hockenbery et al., 1990) suggested
that they also play a crucial role in controlling cell death.
This was subsequently substantiated by an enormous body
of evidence showing that during apoptosis mitochondria
integrate diverse stimuli by releasing protein cofactors
needed for the efﬁcient activation of effector caspases in
the cytosol [for a review, see for example (Danial and
Korsmeyer, 2004; Green and Reed, 1998; Wang, 2001)].
This release is either accompanied or preceded by mito-
chondrial dysfunction, an issue beyond the topic of this
review, but exhaustively addressed by other papers in this
issue and for example by (Bernardi et al., 2001; Green and

Kroemer, 2004). Notwithstanding the recognition of a cru-
cial involvement of mitochondria in apoptosis, the initial
observation that mitochondrial structure was untouched
during the process, as opposed to what happened dur-
ing necrotic death, held true for several years and is still
widely accepted. As a discriminating criterion between
necrosis and apoptosis, Pathology textbooks often indi-
cate the absence of mitochondrial structural changes in
the latter. Alterations in mitochondrial morphology were
occasionally reported during apoptosis (De Vos et al.,
1998; Mancini et al., 1997; Mootha et al., 2001; Sanchez-
Alcazar et al., 2001), but their functional role in pro-
grammed cell death was unclear and they were often
considered as epiphenomena of the caspase-operated cell
dismantling process. Our understanding of the functional
role of mitochondrial structural changes during apopto-
sis greatly improved in the last years. This was mainly
the consequence of a deeper knowledge of the molecular
machinery of mitochondrial fusion and ﬁssion, and of the
use of powerful techniques of electron tomography (ET)
coupled to 3D image reconstruction to investigate mito-
chondrial structure during apoptosis. Here we will discuss
in some details the mechanisms that could participate in

the regulation of inner mitochondrial membrane remod-
eling during apoptosis; and the possible relationship be-
tween dynamics of the inner membrane and that of the
mitochondrial reticulum.

THE MOLECULAR TOOLKIT FOR
MITOCHONDRIAL FUSION AND
FRAGMENTATION

Mitochondria are double-membrane bounded or-
ganelles. It is reasonable to think that fusion-ﬁssion pro-
cesses are therefore highly complex, since they can act on
the two membranes coordinately or separately. A further
level of complexity is added by the organization of the
mitochondrial inner membrane into cristae. Altogether,
these considerations call for a precise regulation of mi-
tochondrial dynamics. “Mitochondria-shaping” proteins,
characterized originally in the budding yeast, include both
pro-fusion and pro-ﬁssion members (Shaw and Nunnari,
2002). Several other mitochondria-shaping proteins have
been identiﬁed in a screening of a yeast petite mutant
library (Dimmer et al., 2002), further conﬁrming how
tightly regulated is this process.

et al., 1999). Thus, inner membrane ﬁssion persists even
when outer membrane ﬁssion is blocked. A possible
participant in inner membrane ﬁssion is Mdm33p, an
inner mitochondrial membrane protein with predicted
coiled-coil domains whose over expression leads to
formation of inner membrane septa followed by ﬁssion of
the mitochondrial reticulum (Messerschmitt et al., 2003).
Fusion process also involves proteins localized
both at the outer and at the inner mitochondrial mem-
brane. A crucial role has been ascribed to the GTPase
Fzo1p (Hermann et al., 1998; Rapaport et al., 1998),
which protrudes towards the cytosol,
interplays with
the adapter Ugo1p in the outer membrane (Sesaki and
Jensen, 2001), and associates with the inner membrane
dynamin-related protein Mgm1p to coordinate the fu-
sion of the four membranes of two juxtaposed mito-
chondria (Sesaki et al., 2003b; Wong et al., 2000; Wong
et al., 2003). Mgm1p is cleaved and presumably acti-
vated by Ugo2p/Pcp1p/Rbd1p, a rhomboid-like protease
of the inner mitochondrial membrane (Herlan et al., 2003;
McQuibban et al., 2003; Sesaki et al., 2003a). In vitro as-
says of reconstituted mitochondrial fusion indicate the re-
quirement of mitochondrial membrane potential for inner
membrane fusion.

Fusion and Fission in Budding Yeast

Fusion and Fission in Mammalian Cells

Among the many genes discovered to affect mito-
chondrial morphology in yeast, some encode for “mas-
ter” proteins that are essential components of the import
machinery (Meisinger et al., 2004) or are structural com-
ponents of the lid of the proteasome (Rinaldi et al., 1998).
Their effect on mitochondrial shape is therefore a sec-
ondary to their primary general function. Other proteins
directly control the fusion–ﬁssion equilibrium and we will
analyze them in deeper detail.

Fission of mitochondrial membranes is accom-
plished by the recruitment of
the dynamin-related
large GTPase Dnm1p to the outer membrane, where it
complexes with the adapter Mdv1p and the integral outer
membrane protein Fis1p (Bleazard et al., 1999; Mozdy
et al., 2000; Sesaki and Jensen, 1999; Tieu et al., 2002).
Another protein, Gag3p, interacts with Dnm1p in a yeast
two-hybrid assay and might function as an essential
component of the severing machinery (Fekkes et al.,
2000). How inner mitochondrial membrane is severed
is still unclear, but experimental evidences suggest that
separate ﬁssion machinery exists. In Caenorhabditis
elegans, expression of dominant negative mutants of
DRP-1, the homologue of yeast Dnm1, results in frag-
mented matrix compartments, which are still connected
each other by tubules of outer membrane (Labrousse

Mammalian orthologues of DNM1 and FIS1, called
dynamin-related protein-1 (Drp-1) and hFis1, respec-
tively, have been identiﬁed and shown to participate in mi-
tochondrial ﬁssion (James et al., 2003a; Labrousse et al.,
1999; Smirnova et al., 2001). Levels of DRP-1 control
mitochondrial ﬁssion and DRP-1 is rapidly degraded, un-
less protected by sumoylation by SUMO1 (Harder et al.,
2004). Endophilin B1, a fatty acyl transferase belong-
ing to a family involved in endocytic vesicle formation,
controls ﬁssion of mitochondrial outer membranes, prob-
ably downstream of DRP-1 (Karbowski et al., 2004b). No
homologues of mdm33p have been identiﬁed so far, but
silencing of mitoﬁlin, a protein of the inner mitochondrial
membrane, has been reported to cause the disappearance
of regular cristae (John et al., 2005). The associated mi-
tochondrial dysfunction questions its speciﬁcity and calls
for deeper analysis.

Two FZO1 homologues have been identiﬁed, mito-
fusin (Mfn) 1 and 2 (Rojo et al., 2002; Santel et al., 2003;
Santel and Fuller, 2001). Both are required for embryonic
development, as substantiated by their genetic ablation in
the mouse (Chen et al., 2003), but it is unclear whether
Mfn redundancy reﬂects functional differences between
MFN1 and MFN2. MFN1 structure has been deeply inves-
tigated, identifying a heptad-repeat region that mediates

Apoptosis and Mitochondrial Fusion–Fission

167

mitochondrial tethering by homotypic trans interaction
prior to fusion (Koshiba et al., 2004). Several functional
data recently emerged on MFN2: inactivating mutations
have been associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth type IIa
axonal neuropathy (Kijima et al., 2005; Zuchner et al.,
2004); levels of MFN2 are reduced in obese patients
(Bach et al., 2003) and its overexpression can inhibit
neointimal proliferation in rodent models of hypertension
(Chen et al., 2004); ability of MFN2 to promote mito-
chondrial fusion is lower than MFN1, correlating with its
GTPase activity (Ishihara et al., 2004). The mammalian
orthologue of mgm1p is the inner membrane dynamin-
related protein OPA1. Mutations in Opa1 are associated
with autosomal dominant optic atrophy (DOA), the lead-
ing cause of inherited blindness (Alexander et al., 2000;
Delettre et al., 2000). Function of OPA1 is unclear as
well as its interaction with other mitochondria shaping
proteins. It has been proposed that OPA1 participates in
a ﬁssion/fragmentation pathway (Griparic et al., 2004;
Misaka et al., 2002; Satoh et al., 2003) or in the mainte-
nance of the structural integrity of the mitochondrial retic-
ulum (Olichon et al., 2003). We therefore took a genetic
approach to investigate the role of OPA1 in shaping mito-
chondria. OPA1 promotes the formation of a branched net-
work of tubular and interconnected mitochondria, which
spans the entire volume of the cytoplasm, as substantiated
by 3D-image reconstruction and volumetric rendering of
stacks of mitochondrial images. Reduction of OPA1 lev-
els by RNA interference (RNAi) results in globular and
fragmented mitochondria as a consequence of reduced fu-
sion, speciﬁcally measured by polyethylene glycol (PEG)
fusion assays. On the other hand, expression of OPA1 in-
creases mitochondrial fusion rates. A genetic dissection
of the determinants of OPA1 function reveals an abso-
lute requirement for MFN1 but not for MFN2. In com-
plex, OPA1 impinges on MFN1-dependent fusion to regu-
late morphology of the mitochondrial reticulum (Cipolat
et al., 2004). Our results raise the question of whether
OPA1 functions primarily at the level of inner membrane,
or it acts as a global controller of the mitochondrial retic-
ulum. This question appears crucial, not only to under-
stand the pathogenesis of dominant optic atrophy in which
OPA1 is mutated, but also to clarify the relative role of
fusion/ﬁssion of the mitochondrial reticulum vs. changes
in the mitochondrial ultrastructure during apoptosis.

STRUCTURE OF MITOCHONDRIAL
INNER MEMBRANE

The complexity of mitochondrial dynamics is fur-
ther bamboozled by the ultrastructural organization of

the inner membrane. Mitochondrial cristae, which ac-
cording to the Palade’s model were widely opened baf-
ﬂes of the inner membrane (Palade, 1952), have been
identiﬁed as a separate compartment connected by nar-
row tubular junctions to the thin intermembrane space
(Frey and Mannella, 2000). This structural organiza-
tion raises two crucial questions: which molecules de-
termine its formation, and which are its functional
consequences.

To date, no single mitochondria-shaping protein has
been identiﬁed to affect only cristae structure. In the bud-
ding yeast, mdm33p as well as mgm1p are required for
normal cristae morphology and at the same time for an ap-
propriate mitochondrial reticulum (Messerschmitt et al.,
2003; Sesaki et al., 2003b; Shepard and Yaffe, 1999; Wong
et al., 2000; Wong et al., 2003). In mammalian cells, lev-
els of OPA1 regulate both mitochondrial ultrastructure
and shape of the mitochondrial reticulum (Cipolat et al.,
2004; Griparic et al., 2004; Olichon et al., 2003). Genetic
tools will probably help us in dissecting the molecular
machinery that regulates cristae morphology. For exam-
ple, our recent discovery that OPA1 needs MFN1 to reg-
ulate dynamics of the mitochondrial reticulum (Cipolat
et al., 2004), suggests that OPA1 could have a further
function in regulating shape of the cristae, this time inde-
pendently from outer membrane fzo1p homologues. Such
a scenario would dissociate genetically and functionally
the effects of OPA1 on the inner vs. those on the outer
membrane.

It has been proposed that mdm38p, which is tar-
geted to the inner mitochondrial membrane, plays a
role in regulating its shape (Dimmer et al., 2002).
This raised considerable interest, since its human ho-
mologue LETM1 is downregulated in Wolff–Hirschhorn
syndrome, a complex genetic disease (Endele et al.,
1999; Schlickum et al., 2004). Recent evidences point
home-
to a role for mdm38p in mitochondrial K
ostasis rather than as a mitochondria-shaping protein
(Nowikovsky et al., 2004). These ﬁndings leave mito-
chondrial inner membrane still without a speciﬁc shaping
protein.

Functional consequences of the inner mitochondrial
membrane compartmentalization have been revealed by
both in silico and wet biology approaches. Computer-
modeling studies suggested gradients of ions and small
molecules along the narrow tubular junction of the cristae.
(Mannella et al., 2001). These junctions are responsible
for the segregation of cytochrome c in the cristae com-
partment (Bernardi and Azzone, 1981; Scorrano et al.,
2002), where the majority of the respiratory chain com-
plexes also localize (D’Herde et al., 2001; Perotti et al.,
1983).

DYNAMIC OF MITOCHONDRIAL INNER
MEMBRANE DURING APOPTOSIS

Intramitochondrial compartmentalization of cy-
tochrome c raised the question of how its release can
be fast and complete in the absence of mitochondrial
swelling. We showed that “BH3-only” members of the
BCL-2 family accomplished it by inducing a profound
remodeling of the cristae, with fusion of the individual
cristae and widening of the narrow tubular junction up
to 70 nm. These changes increase the amount of free cy-
tochrome c that redistributes to the intermembrane space,
from where it can be released in the cytosol trough outer
membrane pathways (Scorrano et al., 2002). A major
dilemma is to understand the molecular mechanisms that
regulate not only cristae formation, but also their remod-
eling during apoptosis. A natural candidate for this has
been suggested in OPA1, which is located at the inner mi-
tochondrial membrane. Down regulation of OPA1 levels
causes mitochondrial fragmentation and dysfunction, with
release of cytochrome c and apoptosis. These are accom-
panied by morphological changes of the cristae (Olichon
et al., 2003), raising the possibility that OPA1 is required
for the maintenance of their shape. Alternatively, cristae
changes could be a consequence of the mitochondrial frag-
mentation induced by silencing of OPA1.

The relationship between ﬁssion and remodeling of
the inner mitochondrial membrane is poorly understood,
but a recent work by Shore and coworkers shed new light
on this. In a set of elegant experiments, they showed that
during apoptosis, mitochondrial Ca2+
uptake results in
DRP-1 mediated mitochondrial ﬁssion and remodeling of
the cristae (Germain et al., 2005). The latter is sensitive
to cyclosporine A, which blocks the permeability transi-
tion pore, a large conductance, voltage dependent channel
of the inner mitochondrial membrane (Bernardi, 1999)
involved in cristae remodeling (Scorrano et al., 2002).
These results raise the intriguing possibility that ﬁssion is
coupled to cristae remodeling trough a yet unknown sig-
nal that propagates from DRP-1 to the inner mitochondrial
membrane. They also call for additional evidence before
concluding that OPA1 controls cristae morphology. An
answer could come from overexpression experiments fol-
lowed by analysis of the shape of the inner membrane in
normal and apoptotic mitochondria. These experiments,
coupled to analyses of intramitochondrial cytochrome c
redistribution, should also answer to another unresolved
question: how does OPA1 control the formation and main-
tenance of the narrow tubular junction? In analogy to the
function of classic dynamins that tubulate membranes by
forming a homopolymeric tangle of interconnected sub-
units around the lipid bundle, it has been proposed that

OPA1 generates and maintains the narrow tubular junc-
tion of the cristae (Shaw and Nunnari, 2002). The general
consensus is that OPA1 is located at the inner mitochon-
drial membrane, facing the intermembrane space (Olichon
et al., 2002; Wong et al., 2000). A tempting hypothesis
is that a ring of OPA1 molecules, inserted or attached
to the neck of the cristae junction, works by pulling the
membrane from inside. This model would be compatible
with the existence of two pools of OPA1, one that reg-
ulates mitochondrial fusion together with MFN1 and is
inserted in the inner membrane, the other only loosely at-
tached to the membrane, perhaps localized at the neck of
the cristae junction, where it controls the diameter of this
structure. The double pool of OPA1 molecules could rep-
resent the mammalian counterpart of mgm1p processing
by pcp1p in the yeast (Herlan et al., 2003; McQuibban
et al., 2003), a protease belonging to the family of rhom-
boid intramembranous proteases that localizes to the inner
mitochondrial membrane. To this end it will be essential
to understand whether PARL, the mammalian homologue
of pcp1p, processes OPA1.

MITOCHONDRIAL FISSION AND APOPTOSIS:
WHICH ROLE FOR THE INNER MEMBRANE?

A set of evidences suggests that mitochondrial ﬁssion
is an early step during apoptosis. Death by mitochondria-
utilizing intrinsic stimuli is accompanied by mitochon-
drial fragmentation and blunted by dominant negative
DRP-1 (Frank et al., 2001). Further analysis revealed
that early in the course of cell death, MFN1 depen-
dent mitochondrial fusion is largely inhibited (Karbowski
et al., 2004a) and combined overexpression of MFN1 and
MFN2 protects from death by intrinsic stimuli like etopo-
side and BID (Sugioka et al., 2004). Similarly, expression
of hFis1 results in cytochrome c release and death (James
et al., 2003b) and its downregulation by RNA interfer-
ence prevents apoptosis to a greater extent than DRP-1
silencing (Lee et al., 2004). A crucial role for the ﬁssion
machinery seems to be conﬁrmed also by results obtained
in the yeast, where DRP-1 homologue dnm1p mediates
mitochondrial fragmentation and death following several
stimuli, suggesting an old evolutionary role for mitochon-
drial ﬁssion in death (Fannjiang et al., 2004). In complex,
these data seem to establish a linear correlation between
fragmentation and apoptosis, but the picture is probably
not so simple. First, not always ﬁssion promotes apopto-
sis, as conﬁrmed by the ability of overexpressed DRP-1
to inhibit death by ceramide (Szabadkai et al., 2004). In
this case, DRP-1 appears to protect by blunting the mi-
tochondrial Ca2+
waves that transmit ceramide-mediated

Apoptosis and Mitochondrial Fusion–Fission

169

apoptotic signal (Pacher and Hajnoczky, 2001). Second,
a crucial recent ﬁnding by the group of G. Shore showed
DRP-1 dependent remodeling of the inner membrane dur-
ing apoptosis, establishing for the ﬁrst time a relationship
between changes in the morphology of the mitochondrial
reticulum and remodelling of cristae structure. These ex-
periments suggest for the ﬁrst time a potential mechanism
for the effect of mitochondria-shaping proteins on death: if
ﬁssion is associated with cristae remodeling, fragmented
mitochondria are prompted for maximal release of cy-
tochrome c. Further analysis is required to support this
possibility, but if it stands, nature would have marveled
us once more, coupling ﬁssion of the outer membrane to
fusion of the individual cristae.
