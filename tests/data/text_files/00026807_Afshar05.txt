Summary
Understanding  of  the  mechanisms  governing  spindle
positioning 
remains
incomplete.  During  unequal  division  of  one-cell  stage  C.
elegans embryos, the G␣␣ proteins GOA-1 and GPA-16 act
in a partially redundant manner to generate pulling forces
along astral microtubules. Previous work focused primarily
on  GOA-1,  whereas  the  mechanisms  by  which  GPA-16
participates in this process are not well understood. Here,
we  report  that  GPA-16  is  present  predominantly  at
the
cortex  of  one-cell  stage  embryos.  Using  co-
immunoprecipitation  and  surface  plasmon  resonance
binding assays, we ﬁnd that GPA-16 associates with RIC-8
and  GPR-1/2,  two  proteins  known  to  be  required  for
pulling force generation. Using spindle severing as an assay
for pulling forces, we demonstrate that inactivation of the
G␤␤ protein  GPB-1  renders  GPA-16  and  GOA-1  entirely
redundant.  This  suggests  that  the  two  G␣␣ proteins  can

Introduction
Asymmetric divisions play a crucial role in the generation of
cell  diversity.  During  development  in  particular,  asymmetric
divisions often give rise to daughter cells that differ not only
in  fates,  but  also  in  sizes  (for  a  review,  see  Horvitz  and
Herskowitz, 1992). In animal cells, such unequal divisions rely
on  the  eccentric  position  of  the  mitotic  spindle  because  the
cleavage furrow is speciﬁed so as to bisect the spindle by the
end of anaphase (for a review, see Rappaport, 1971).

The  one-cell  stage  C.  elegans embryo  has  emerged  as  an
attractive  model  to  analyze  the  mechanisms  of  cell-intrinsic
spindle positioning during unequal cell division (for a review,
see  Schneider  and  Bowerman,  2003).  In  the  wild  type,  in
response to anteroposterior (AP) polarity cues, the spindle is
displaced  towards  the  posterior  by  the  end  of  anaphase,
resulting  in  unequal  cleavage  into  a  larger  anterior  and
a
spindle
displacement results from unbalanced cortical force generators
acting  on  astral  microtubules  and  pulling  on  spindle  poles
(Grill  et  al.,  2001;  Grill  et  al.,  2003).  Because  more  force
generators are active on the posterior cortex, there is a larger
net  force  pulling  on  the  posterior  spindle  pole  (Grill  et  al.,
2003).

activate the same pathway and that their dual presence is
normally  needed  to  counter  G␤␤␥␥.  Using  nucleotide
exchange assays, we establish that whereas GPR-1/2 acts as
a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI) for GPA-
16, as it does for GOA-1, RIC-8 does not exhibit guanine
nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity towards GPA-16,
in contrast to its effect on GOA-1. We establish in addition
that RIC-8 is required for cortical localization of GPA-16,
whereas it is not required for that of GOA-1. Our analysis
demonstrates  that  this  requirement  toward  GPA-16  is
distinct  from  the  known  function  of  RIC-8  in  enabling
interaction  between  G␣␣ proteins  and  GPR-1/2,  thus
providing novel insight into the mechanisms of asymmetric
spindle positioning.

Key words: C. elegans embryos, Spindle positioning, G protein

Although the molecular nature of cortical force generators
is  not  known,  their  activity  relies  on  two  ␣ subunits  of  the
heterotrimeric G-proteins: GOA-1 and GPA-16 (see Fig. S1 in
the  supplementary  material).  These  components  act  in  a
partially redundant manner, as pulling forces are decreased in
only  a  modest  manner  in  embryos  lacking  either  GOA-1  or
GPA-16 (Afshar et al., 2004), still allowing asymmetric spindle
elongation and unequal cleavage (Gotta and Ahringer, 2001).
By contrast, simultaneous inactivation of GOA-1 and GPA-16
results in an extreme decrease of pulling forces (Colombo et
al.,  2003),  yielding  symmetric  spindle  elongation  and  equal
ﬁrst  cleavage  (Gotta  and  Ahringer,  2001).  Conversely,
inactivation of G␤␥ results in excess pulling forces (Afshar et
al., 2004). Furthermore, the triple inactivation of GOA-1, GPA-
16 and G␤␥ also yields an equal ﬁrst cleavage, as in goa-1/gpa-
16(RNAi) embryos  (Gotta  and  Ahringer,  2001;  Tsou  et  al.,
2003),  indicating  that  G␤␥ dampens  G␣-dependent  force
generation in one-cell stage embryos.

A  phenotype  analogous  to  that  of  goa-1/gpa-16(RNAi) is
observed after inactivation of GPR-1/2 (Colombo et al., 2003;
Gotta et al., 2003; Srinivasan et al., 2003), a GoLoco protein
which acts as a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI)
for GOA-1 (Afshar et al., 2004; Gotta et al., 2003) or of LIN-

5, a coiled-coil protein that physically interacts with GPR-1/2
(Lorson  et  al.,  2000;  Srinivasan  et  al.,  2003).  GPR-1/2  and
LIN-5  are  present  at  the  cortex  of  one-cell  stage  embryos
(Colombo  et  al.,  2003;  Gotta  et  al.,  2003;  Srinivasan  et  al.,
2003).  During  mitosis,  cortical  GPR-1/2  distribution  is
asymmetric, with a slight enrichment at the posterior (Colombo
et al., 2003; Gotta et al., 2003; Tsou et al., 2003). This raises
the  possibility  that  GPR-1/2  is  responsible  for  the  larger  net
pulling  force  exerted  on  the  posterior  spindle  pole.  RIC-8,
which acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for
GOA-1 (Afshar et al., 2004; Hess et al., 2004), is also required
for  pulling  force  generation  (Afshar  et  al.,  2004).  Co-
immunoprecipitation  experiments  and  biochemical  analyses
indicate  that  RIC-8  is  required  for  the  interaction  between
GPR-1/2  and  GOA-1,  raising  the  possibility  that  RIC-8  acts
before GPR-1/2 in the GOA-1 activation cycle (Afshar et al.,
2004).  Moreover,  inactivation  of  the  G␤ subunit  GPB-1
alleviates 
for  RIC-8  during  spindle
positioning,  suggesting  that  RIC-8  promotes  generation  of
GOA-1 free from G␤␥, thus making it available for binding to
GPR-1/2 (Afshar et al., 2004) (for a review, see McCudden et
al., 2005).

Whereas GOA-1 is known to be present at the cortex of early
embryos (Afshar et al., 2004; Gotta and Ahringer, 2001; Miller
and  Rand,  2000),  the  subcellular  distribution  of  GPA-16  has
not  been  investigated.  Moreover,  although  yeast  two-hybrid
assays indicate that GPA-16 can physically interact with RIC-
8 (Afshar et al., 2004) and GPR-1/2 (Li et al., 2004), the latter
interaction was not detected in two other studies (Colombo et
al.,  2003;  Gotta  et  al.,  2003),  and  whether  such  interactions
occur  in  C.  elegans embryos  is  not  known.  Furthermore,  the
consequence  of  putative  interactions  of  GPA-16  with  RIC-8
and GPR-1/2 has not been investigated. In addition, the nature
of the partial redundancy between GPA-16 and GOA-1 has not
been addressed. For example, GPA-16 and GOA-1 could each
be  essential  for  activation  of  separate  pathways  that  trigger
distinct  effectors,  which  together  ensure  force  generation.
Alternatively,  GPA-16  and  GOA-1  could  each  contribute  to
partial activation of the same pathway. 

We  investigated  these  issues  in  this  study.  We  report  that
GPA-16 is present predominantly at the cell cortex and that it
interacts with RIC-8 and GPR-1/2, both in vitro and in vivo.
We show that GPA-16 and GOA-1 become entirely redundant
after GPB-1 inactivation, suggesting that the two G␣ proteins
can activate the same pathway. Furthermore, we establish that
GPR-1/2 acts as a GDI for GPA-16, whereas RIC-8 does not
act as a GEF for GPA-16. Importantly, we ﬁnd that RIC-8 is
required  for  GPA-16  cortical  localization  and  that  this  novel
requirement  is  distinct  from  its  known  role  in  enabling
interaction between G␣ proteins and GPR-1/2. 

Materials and methods
Nematode strains and RNAi
Wild-type (N2), ric-8(md303) and ric-8(md1909) (Miller et al., 2000),
goa-1(sa734) (Robatzek  and  Thomas,  2000),  and  gpa-16(it143)
(Bergmann et al., 2003) mutant strains of C. elegans were cultured at
16°C  according  to  standard  procedures  (Brenner,  1974).  ric-8 and
gpa-16 mutant animals were typically shifted to 20°C >36 hours prior
to analysis. We found that the spindle positioning phenotype of gpa-
16(it143) mutant  embryos 
is  not  markedly  different  when

homozygous mutant animals are raised at 20°C or at 25°C (data not
shown). Nevertheless, we performed spindle severing experiments on
gpa-16(it143) mutant  embryos  at  25°C 
to  ensure  maximal
inactivation.

Bacterial  RNAi  feeding  strains  were  as  described  (Afshar  et  al.,
2004;  Colombo  et  al.,  2003).  The  conditions  for  RNAi  by  feeding
were  as  follows,  starting  with  L3/L4  larvae:  gpa-16, goa-1,  gpb-1
and gpr-1/2: 48-60 hours at 20°C; ric-8: 40-44 hours at 20°C. RNAi-
mediated inactivation of ric-8 in ric-8(md1909) mutant animals was
performed as described (Afshar et al., 2004). For experiments where
two  genes  were  inactivated  with  RNAi,  appropriate  controls  were
performed  in  parallel  to  ensure  the  efficiency  of  each  RNAi
condition.

Microscopy and spindle severing
Time-lapse DIC microscopy was performed capturing 1 image every
5  seconds  (Gönczy  et  al.,  1999).  Spindle  severing  experiments  and
measurement of peak velocities were performed essentially as before
(Grill et al., 2001), using a Leica LMD microscope equipped with a
pulsed N2 laser (␭=337 nM).

Antibody production and use
For  generating  GPA-16  antibodies,  the  full-length  gpa-16 cDNA
(Colombo  et  al.,  2003)  was  cloned  into  pGEX-6P-2.  GST-GPA-16
was expressed, puriﬁed from inclusion bodies, run on an SDS-PAGE
gel  and  injected  into  a  rabbit  (Eurogentec).  Antibodies  were  strip-
puriﬁed against GST-GPA-16, eluting with 0.1 M glycine (pH 2.5).
Affinity-puriﬁed  antibodies  were  dialyzed  against  PBS  and  kept  at
–20°C in 50% glycerol.

For revealing RIC-8 following immunoprecipitation with GPA-16
antibodies (Fig. 2A, Fig. 5E), we generated RIC-8 antibodies by ﬁrst
cloning the full length ric-8 cDNA into a pGEX derivative. Bacterially
expressed GST-RIC-8 was puriﬁed from inclusion bodies, puriﬁed on
an SDS-PAGE gel and injected into a rabbit (Eurogentec). Antibodies
were column affinity puriﬁed against His6-RIC-8 bound to a HiTrap
NHS  Hp  column  (Pharmacia),  dialyzed  and  stored  as  above.  These
antibodies  (see  Fig.  S4  in  the  supplementary  material)  were  used
following  immunoprecipitation  with  GPA-16  antibodies  in  place  of
previously described antibodies (Miller et al., 2000) (which were used
in the case of Fig. 2B) because they are more sensitive.

Fixation and staining of embryos for indirect immunoﬂuorescence
was  as  described  (Afshar  et  al.,  2004).  The  following  primary
antibodies  were  used:  1:200  mouse  anti-␣ tubulin  (DM1A,  Sigma),
1:300  rabbit  anti-GPA-16  (this  study),  1:300  rabbit  anti-GOA-1
(Afshar et al., 2004) and 1:150 rabbit anti-GPR-1/2 (Colombo et al.,
2003). Secondary antibodies were 1:500 goat anti-mouse conjugated
to  Alexa-488  (Molecular  Probes)  and  1:1000  goat  anti-rabbit
conjugated to Cy3. Slides were counterstained with ~1 ␮g/ml Hoechst
33258  (Sigma)  to  detect  DNA.  Approximately  1 ␮m  optical  slices
were  collected  on  an  LSM510  Zeiss  confocal  microscope  and
processed in Adobe Photoshop. Quantiﬁcation of GPR-1/2 signal was
performed on images collected on a Zeiss Axioplan 2 with at 12-bit
Diagnostic  Instrument  Spot  RT  Camera  controlled  by  Metamorph
software  (Universal  Imaging).  Average  cortical  intensities  were
determined  in  a  ~5 ␮m-long  region  between  the  EMS  and  ABp
blastomeres, after subtraction of the average cytoplasmic signal from
a neighboring region.

Generation of embryonic extracts, immunoprecipitation (using ~3
␮g  of  GPA-16  antibodies  without  addition  of  guanine  nucleotides,
unless speciﬁed otherwise) and western blot analysis were performed
as described (Afshar et al., 2004). All primary antibodies for western
blot analysis were used at 1:1000, except the new RIC-8 antibodies,
which  were  used  at  1:2000.  For  secondary  antibodies,  we  used
1:10,000 HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Amersham), except when
revealing  GPR-1/2,  where  HRP-conjugated  Protein  A  (Amersham)
was used at 1:2000 in place of secondary antibodies because the heavy
chain of immunoglobulins is similar in size to GPR-1/2.

DevelopmentProtein puriﬁcation
Puriﬁcation of GOA-1 (amino acids 28-351) and His6-RIC-8 was as
described (Afshar et al., 2004). The RIC-8 open reading frame (ORF)
was cloned into pGEX4TEV2 (Kimple et al., 2004) and GST-RIC-8
puriﬁed  by  chromatographic  methods  as  previously  described
(Willard  and  Siderovski,  2004).  We  have  previously  observed
aggregation  of  RIC-8  during  puriﬁcation  (Afshar  et  al.,  2004);
accordingly  chromatography  buffers  were  supplemented  with  400
mM NaCl and 5-10% (v/v) glycerol. GST-GPR-1/2 (amino acids 374-
476)  was  cloned  into  pGEX4TEV2  and  puriﬁed  using  the  methods
described above.

All baculoviral and insect cell culture reagents were obtained from
Invitrogen. DNA encoding GPA-16 (amino acids 5-357) was cloned
into pFastBacHTb and recombinant bacmid DNA was generated using
the Bac-to-Bac method. Insect cell transfection and viral ampliﬁcation
were performed by the Tissue Culture Core Laboratory (University of
Colorado  Cancer  Center).  Protein  was  expressed  by  infecting  Hi5
cells (1.0⫻106 cells/ml) grown in Express Five SFM (containing 16.5
mM  L-glutamine)  with  baculovirus  at  a  multiplicity  of  infection  of
1.0.  After  incubation  at  27°C  for  2  days,  cells  were  pelleted  by
centrifugation  at  3000  g,  and  resuspended  in  buffer  N  [50  mM
Tris/HCl  (pH  7.5),  100  mM  NaCl,  5%  (v/v)  glycerol,  10  mM
imidazole, 50 ␮M GDP, 20 mM NaF, 30 ␮M AlCl3, 5 mM MgCl2,
0.5% (w/v) sodium cholate and 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol]. His6-GPA-
16 was then puriﬁed using Ni2+-affinity chromatographic methods as
described 
(Willard  and  Siderovski,  2004).  Protein-containing
fractions were pooled and subjected to HiTrapQ (Amersham) anion
exchange chromatography. The eluent was 20 mM Tris/HCl (pH 8.0),
10 mM NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 10 ␮M GDP and 1 mM DTT; protein
was eluted with a linear gradient of 0-300 mM NaCl over 20 column
volumes. Protein fractions were analyzed for the presence GPA-16 by
SDS-PAGE/Coomassie  Blue  staining,  immunoblot  with  ␣-His6
antibodies  (Covance)  and  GTP␥S  binding.  His6-GPA-16  containing
fractions  were  pooled  and  concentrated  using  a  Vivaspin  30  kDa
cutoff centrifugal ﬁlter (Sartorius).

Biochemical assays
[35S]-GTP␥S binding assays were performed as described (Afshar et
al., 2004). Rates of GTP␥S binding were calculated using a one-site
exponential model (Prism v4.0; GraphPad Software). Protein-protein
interactions  were  measured  by  surface  plasmon  resonance  (SPR)
spectroscopy as described (Kimple et al., 2004). Eluent buffer [20 mM
HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.005% (v/v) NP-40]
was  supplemented  with  GDP  (50 ␮M),  GTP␥S  (50 ␮M),  or
– (50 ␮M GDP, 20 mM NaF, 30 ␮M AlCl3). GOA-1 and
GDP·AlF4
–
GPA-16 were diluted to 2 ␮M in the GDP, GTP␥S, and GDP·AlF4
buffers, and incubated for 30 minutes at 25°C to ensure full nucleotide
loading.  Nucleotide-locked  G␣ proteins  (2 ␮M)  were  injected
(KINJECT, 30 ␮l, 300 s dissociation time, 5 ␮l/minute) over an anti-
GST antibody-conjugated CM5 sensor chip, loaded with GST (1500
RU), GST-RIC-8 (800 RU) and GST-GPR-1 (amino acids 374-476)
(1400 RU). Background binding to the GST surface was subtracted
from all sensorgrams (BIAevaluation v3.0; Biacore).

Results
GPA-16 is present at the cortex of early embryonic
blastomeres
We sought to determine the subcellular distribution of GPA-16
in  early  C.  elegans embryos.  We  raised  and  affinity-puriﬁed
antibodies  which  recognize  a  major  species  of  the  expected
size in wild-type embryonic extracts that is vastly diminished
in  gpa-16(RNAi) embryonic  extracts  (Fig.  1A).  These
antibodies detect a strong and uniform signal at the cell cortex
of early embryos (Fig. 1B,C). This distribution corresponds to

bona ﬁde GPA-16 because it is signiﬁcantly diminished in gpa-
16(RNAi) embryos (Fig. 1D). These antibodies also label the
cytoplasm,  with  a  slight  enrichment  in  the  vicinity  of
microtubule  asters,  but  this  aspect  of  the  signal  is  barely
diminished  in  gpa-16(RNAi)  embryos  (Fig.  1D),  suggesting
that it is not speciﬁc or corresponds to a particularly stable pool
of GPA-16. In summary, GPA-16 is present predominantly at
the cortex of one-cell stage embryos.

GPA-16 interacts with RIC-8 and GPR-1/2 in vivo
We investigated whether GPA-16 is present in a complex with
RIC-8  and  GPR-1/2  in  C.  elegans embryos.  As  shown  in
Fig. 2A  (lane  7),  we  found  that  GPA-16  antibodies  co-
immunoprecipitate  both  RIC-8  and  GPR-1/2  from  wild-type
embryonic extracts. Furthermore, we found that the interaction
between  GPA-16  and  RIC-8  is  severely  compromised  in
embryonic  extracts  derived  from  ric-8(md1909) or  ric-
8(md303) mutant animals (Fig. 2A, lane 8 and data not shown).
These observations establish that GPA-16 normally associates
with both RIC-8 and GPR-1/2 in vivo.

We next addressed the order in which GPA-16 interacts with
RIC-8  and  GPR-1/2  by  conducting  co-immunoprecipitation
experiments  in  embryonic  extracts  depleted  of  RIC-8  or
GPR-1/2.  These  experiments  established  that  the  interaction
between  GPA-16  and  RIC-8  is  not  altered  in  gpr-1/2(RNAi)
embryonic extracts (Fig. 2A, lane 11, compare with lane 7).
By contrast, the interaction between GPA-16 and GPR-1/2 is
essentially  abolished  in  ric-8(md1909) or  ric-8(md303)
embryonic extracts (Fig. 2A, lane 8, compare with lane 7 and
data  not  shown).  We  conclude  that  RIC-8  is  required  for
efficient assembly of a complex containing GPA-16 and GPR-
1/2.

These  ﬁndings  prompted  us  to  test  whether  RIC-8  may
activate GPA-16 by supporting stable levels of G␤␥-free GPA-
16. If this were the case, then inactivation of G␤␥ might enable
GPA-16  to  interact  with  GPR-1/2  in  the  absence  of  RIC-8.
Accordingly,  we  found  that  the  interaction  between  GPA-16
and  GPR-1/2  is  partially  restored  in  ric-8(md1909)  gpb-
1(RNAi) embryos  (Fig.  2A,  lane  10,  compare  with  lane  8).
Therefore, as for GOA-1 (Afshar et al., 2004), inactivation of
G␤␥ alleviates  the  need  for  RIC-8  to  permit  association  of
GPR-1/2 with GPA-16.

GOA-1 and GPA-16 become completely redundant
during asymmetric cell division when GPB-1 is
inactivated
As  our  ﬁndings  suggest  that  generation  of  both  GOA-1  and
GPA-16  free  from  G␤␥ is  important  for  asymmetric  spindle
positioning,  we 
the  partial
redundancy between the two G␣ proteins. We reasoned that if
GPA-16  and  GOA-1  are  essential  for  distinct  pathways,  an
excess of GPA-16 liberated from G␤␥ should not compensate
for  loss  of  GOA-1.  Similarly,  an  excess  of  GOA-1  liberated
from G␤␥ should not compensate for loss of GPA-16.

results in a G202D substitution in the switch II region of the
GTPase domain (Bergmann et al., 2003), and RNAi-mediated
inactivation  of  goa-1 or  gpa-16.  We  inactivated  gpb-1 using
RNAi,  because  gpb-1 homozygous  mutant  animals  die  as
larvae (Zwaal et al., 1996).

The  outcome  of  the  spindle  severing  experiments  is
summarized  in  Fig.  3  and  Table  S1  in  the  supplementary
material.  After  spindle  severing  in  wild-type  one-cell  stage
embryos, the peak velocity of the anterior spindle pole is ~0.64
␮m/second, whereas that of the posterior spindle pole is ~1.1
␮m/second,  reﬂecting  the  imbalance  of  net  pulling  forces
acting on the two spindle poles (see also Afshar et al., 2004;
Grill et al., 2001). Inactivation of either goa-1 or gpa-16 results
in  diminished  peak  velocities  of  both  spindle  poles  (see  also
Afshar et al., 2004). In contrast,  gpb-1(RNAi) results in high
peak  velocities  of  both  spindle  poles  (~1.0 ␮m/second)  (see
also  Afshar  et  al.,  2004).  Importantly,  we  found  that  goa-

1(sa734) gpb-1(RNAi) or goa-1(RNAi) gpb-1(RNAi), and gpa-
16(it143) gpb-1(RNAi) or gpa-16(RNAi) gpb-1(RNAi) embryos
exhibit a phenotype indistinguishable from that of gpb-1(RNAi)
embryos, in that peak velocities of both spindle poles are high.
This is not due to upregulation of GOA-1 or GPA-16 protein
in the absence of the other G␣ subunit (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and
4).  As  expected  from  previous  reports  (Gotta  and  Ahringer,
2001; Tsou et al., 2003), we found, in addition, that following
triple inactivation of goa-1 gpa-16 and gpb-1, peak velocities
are  analogous  to  those  observed  in  goa-1/gpa-16(RNAi)
embryos (Colombo et al., 2003), indicating that G␤␥ normally
dampens G␣-dependent force generation.

An  examination  of  GPR-1/2  cortical  distribution  in  early
two-cell stage embryo corroborated the outcome of the spindle

1/2, and for normal GPA-16 protein levels. (A) Embryonic extracts
of the indicated genotypes were immunoprecipitated with GPA-16
antibodies and analyzed by western blot using RIC-8, GPR-1/2 or
GPA-16 antibodies, as indicated on the left by arrowheads. The top
panel shows inputs (1/50 of starting materials). Whereas GPA-16
antibodies co-immunoprecipitate both RIC-8 and GPR-1/2, RIC-8 or
GPR-1/2 antibodies do not co-immunoprecipitate GPA-16 (data not
shown). Lanes 1-5 and 7-11 are from the same experiment; lanes 6
and 12 from a different experiment performed with appropriate
controls. GPA-16 levels are diminished in inputs from the gpb-
1(RNAi) embryonic extract. Quantiﬁcations of the intensity of the
GPA-16 band from four experiments, using the ␣-tubulin or the
GPR-1/2 band as loading control, indicate that the amount of GPA-
16 in ric-8(md1909) and in gpb-1(RNAi) embryos is essentially
identical [ratio of gpb-1(RNAi) versus ric-8(md1909):1.15; s.d.=0.4].

with 4D and 4A).

We conclude that GPA-16 and GOA-1 become completely
redundant for GPR-1/2 cortical localization and asymmetric
spindle  positioning  when  G␤␥ is  inactivated.  This  suggests
that  excess  GPA-16  liberated  from  G␤␥ can  compensate
for a loss  of  GOA-1,  and  vice  versa.  Therefore,  instead  of
being  essential  for  distinct  pathways,  GPA-16  and  GOA-1
appear  to  each  contribute  to  partial  activation  of  the  same
pathway.

GPR-1/2 is a GDI for GPA-16, but RIC-8 is not a GEF
for GPA-16
Next,  we  set  out  to  determine  whether  RIC-8  and  GPR-1/2
exhibit the same biochemical activity towards GPA-16 as they
do  toward  GOA-1.  To  this  end,  we  ﬁrst  conducted  surface
plasmon  resonance  (SPR)  binding  assays  to  investigate  the
nucleotide dependency of the interaction between GPA-16 and
GPR-1/2,  as  well  as  that  between  GPA-16  and  RIC-8.

results  were  obtained  with  goa-1(sa734) and  gpa-16(it143)

contribute to GPR-1/2 cortical targeting. As anticipated from

Recombinant  GPA-16  was  injected  over  SPR  surfaces  after
pre-incubation  with  either  GDP,  the  non-hydrolyzable  GTP
– to mimic the transition state
analogue GTP␥S, or GDP·AlF4
of  GTP  hydrolysis.  We  found  that  a  GST  fusion  protein
encompassing the GoLoco motif of GPR-1/2 binds exclusively
to  GPA-16·GDP  (Fig.  5A).  We  found  also  that  a  surface  of
immobilized  GST-RIC-8  binds  robustly  to  GPA-16·GDP,  but
–-activated
to  a  much  lesser  extent  to  GTP␥S-bound  or  AlF4
GPA-16 (Fig. 5B).

We  conducted  [35S]GTP␥S  radioligand  binding  assays  to
determine the effect of GPR-1/2 and of RIC-8 on the kinetics
of GTP␥S binding to GPA-16. As shown in Fig. 5C, we found
that  a  peptide  encompassing  an  extended  GPR-1/2  GoLoco
motif  exhibits  GDI  activity  towards  GPA-16,  in  a  manner
analogous  to  its  effect  on  GOA-1  (Afshar  et  al.,  2004).
Unexpectedly, we found that the presence of RIC-8, even in a
20-fold  molar  excess,  does  not  alter  the  kinetics  of  GTP␥S
binding to GPA-16 (Fig. 5D). SPR-binding assays established
that this preparation of RIC-8 binds robustly to GOA-1·GDP
(Fig. 5E), as shown previously (Afshar et al., 2004). Moreover,
a  twofold  molar  excess  of  the  same  preparation  of  RIC-8
signiﬁcantly accelerates [35S]GTP␥S binding to GOA-1 (Fig.
5F), consistent with previous results (Afshar et al., 2004; Hess
et al., 2004). Taken together, these ﬁndings lead us to conclude
that  in  vitro,  RIC-8  acts  as  a  GEF  towards  GOA-1  but  not
towards GPA-16.

We  reasoned  that  if  RIC-8  also  does  not  act  as  a  GEF
towards GPA-16 in vivo, it could remain associated with GPA-
16 even after spontaneous nucleotide exchange has occurred,

especially  in  light  of  the  slight  binding  of  RIC-8  to  GPA-
– observed in vitro (see Fig.
16·GTP␥S and GPA-16·GDP·AlF4
5B).  Compatible  with  this  view,  we  found  that  GPA-16
antibodies  co-immunoprecipitate  RIC-8  equally  well  in  the
presence  of  excess  GDP  or  GTP␥S  (Fig.  5G).  By  contrast,
GOA-1 antibodies co-immunoprecipitate RIC-8 preferentially
in  the  presence  of  excess  GDP  (Fig.  5H)  (see  also  Afshar  et
al., 2004). As expected, we found also that GPA-16 antibodies
co-immunoprecipitate GPR-1/2 only in the presence of excess
GDP (Fig. 5E), as is the case with GOA-1 antibodies (Afshar
et al., 2004).

Overall, our ﬁndings indicate that whereas GPR-1/2 acts as
a GDI towards both GOA-1 and GPA-16, RIC-8 exhibits GEF
activity towards GOA-1, but not GPA-16.

RIC-8 ensures normal cortical localization and
protein levels of GPA-16
Despite RIC-8 not acting as a GEF towards GPA-16, RIC-8 is
required for GPA-16 function during asymmetric cell division,
as  RIC-8  inactivation  results  in  a  phenotype  analogous  to
inactivating both GOA-1 and GPA-16 (Afshar et al., 2004). To
begin investigating how RIC-8 exerts its requirement towards
GPA-16,  we  examined  the  distribution  of  GPA-16  in  ric-8
mutant embryos. Strikingly, we found that GPA-16 distribution
at the cortex is extremely diminished when RIC-8 function is
compromised  (Fig.  1E,F,  compare  with  1C).  Moreover,
western  blot  analysis  revealed  a  severe  reduction  in  GPA-16
protein  levels  in  ric-8 mutant  embryonic  extracts  (Fig.  2B,
lanes 5-7, compare with lane 1).

Developmentrequirement 

By  contrast,  RIC-8  is  not  required  for  normal  GOA-1
distribution  (Afshar  et  al.,  2004)  or  protein  levels  (Fig.  2B,
lanes  5-7,  compare  with  lane  1),  indicating  speciﬁcity  in
its
for  GPA-16.  Furthermore,  RIC-8
distribution and  levels  are  not  affected  in  gpa-16(RNAi)
embryos (Fig. 2B, lane 2; data not shown), indicating that this
requirement is not reciprocal. Overall, we conclude that RIC-
8  is  required  for  normal  cortical  localization  and  protein
levels of GPA-16.

Compromising the function of GOA-1 and RIC-8 is
more detrimental than compromising that of GPA-16
and RIC-8
The  above  observations  suggest  that  compromising  RIC-8
function  may  be  more  detrimental  to  embryos  depleted  of
GOA-1 than to embryos depleted of GPA-16, because GPA-16
levels are already severely compromised in the absence of RIC-
8.  To  test  this  prediction,  we  performed  time-lapse  DIC
microscopy of one-cell stage embryos. We compromised goa-

for  the  following  reasons.  First,  using  time-lapse  DIC
microscopy  and  spindle  severing,  we  found  that  the  spindle
positioning phenotypes in goa-1(RNAi) and the deletion allele
goa-1(sa734) are  indistinguishable  (see  Table  S1  in  the
supplementary  material).  Moreover,  ric-8(md1909) goa-
1(RNAi) embryos already have a penetrant spindle positioning
phenotype.  Second,  null  allele  of  gpa-16 are  not  available
(Bergmann et al., 2003), and we found using spindle severing
that  the  impairment  of  force  generation  in  gpa-16(RNAi)
embryos  is  as  severe  as  that  in  gpa-16(it143) embryos  (see

oscillations are dampened, but asymmetric spindle positioning
is  nevertheless  achieved,  resulting  in  unequal  cleavage  (Fig.

The requirement of RIC-8 for normal GPA-16 cortical
localization and protein levels is distinct from that
enabling interaction between GPA-16 and GPR-1/2
Reduced  GPA-16  cortical  localization  and  protein  levels  in
ric-8 mutant embryos could be due to the lack of interaction
between  GPA-16  and  GPR-1/2  or  instead  uncover  a  novel
requirement  for  RIC-8.  If  the  former  was  the  case,  then
mutations  that  impair  the  interaction  between  GPA-16  and
GPR-1/2  should  necessarily  result  in  reduced  GPA-16
cortical  localization  and  protein  levels.  Contrary  to  this
prediction, we found that GPA-16 distribution and levels are
normal  in  gpa-16(it143) mutant  embryos  (Fig.  1G  and  Fig.
2B,  lane  3,  compare  with  lane  1)  (Bergmann  et  al.,  2003),
despite the interaction between GPA-16 and both RIC-8 and
GPR-1/2  being  severely  diminished  (Fig.  2A,  lane  12,
compare  with  lane  7).  In  addition,  we  found  that  GPA-16
cortical  localization  and  protein  levels  are  compromised  in
(Fig.  1H;  data  not  shown),
gpa-16(it143)
indicating that the mutation in gpa-16(it143) does not render
GPA-16 insensitive to RIC-8. Overall, these ﬁndings suggest

ric-8(RNAi)

that  the  requirement  of  RIC-8  for  ensuring  normal  GPA-16
cortical  localization  and  protein  levels  is  novel  and  distinct
from  its  known  role  in  enabling  interaction  between  G␣
proteins and GPR-1/2.

RIC-8 is required for cortical localization of GPA-16
and thereby for maintaining normal protein levels
At  least  two  scenarios  can  be  envisaged  to  explain  the  dual
requirement  of  RIC-8  in  ensuring  normal  GPA-16  cortical
localization  and  protein  levels.  First,  RIC-8  may  be  required
primarily for normal GPA-16 protein levels, with the lack of
cortical localization being a consequence of having insufficient
GPA-16 protein in the absence of RIC-8. Alternatively, RIC-8
may be required primarily for cortical localization of GPA-16,
with the diminution in protein levels being a consequence of
failed GPA-16 localization in the absence of RIC-8.

An  examination  of  GPA-16  distribution  in  gpb-1(RNAi)
embryos  leads  us  to  favor  the  latter  scenario.  We  found  that
GPA-16 protein levels are severely diminished in such embryos
(Fig. 2A, lane 3, compare with lane 1), to an extent comparable

Developmentwith that observed in ric-8(md1909) mutant embryos (Fig. 2A,
compare lanes 2 and 3). Importantly, in addition, we found that
GPA-16 is present at the cortex of gpb-1(RNAi) embryos (Fig.
1I). Although we cannot exclude that GPA-16 in gpb-1(RNAi)
embryos  is  targeted  to  the  cortex  in  a  manner  that  does  not
occur in the wild type, these observations render it unlikely that
lack of GPA-16 cortical localization in ric-8(md1909) mutant
embryos is due merely to diminished protein levels. Therefore,
we propose that RIC-8 is required for cortical localization of
GPA-16 during asymmetric division of C. elegans embryos.

Discussion
Heterotrimeric G␣ proteins are crucial for spindle positioning
in  C.  elegans,  Drosophila  melanogaster and  vertebrate  cells
(for a review, see Hampoelz and Knoblich, 2004). In the one-
cell  stage  C.  elegans embryo,  the  G␣ proteins  GPA-16  and
GOA-1  act  in  a  partially  redundant  manner  to  ensure
generation  of  pulling  forces  during  asymmetric  spindle
positioning. Previous work has focused on the mechanism by
which RIC-8 and GPR-1/2 regulate GOA-1 function. Whether
similar mechanisms hold for GPA-16 has not been previously
addressed.

Distinct regulation of GPA-16 and GOA-1 during
asymmetric cell division
In this study, we establish that the interaction of GPA-16 with
GPR-1/2 requires RIC-8, and that this requirement is alleviated
when G␤␥ is inactivated. Moreover, we ﬁnd that GPR-1/2 acts
as a GDI towards GPA-16. Whereas these ﬁndings mirror those
made  with  GOA-1  (Afshar  et  al.,  2004),  we  show  also  that
GPA-16  differs  in  two  important  ways  from  GOA-1  with
respect to its relationships with RIC-8. First, RIC-8 does not
exhibit GEF activity towards GPA-16, in contrast to its effect
on  GOA-1.  Consistent  with  our  ﬁndings,  yeast  two  hybrid
experiments indicate that rat Ric8 isoforms interact with both
wild type and mutant GTP-ase deﬁcient, G␣q and G␣o (Tall et
al.,  2003).  Interestingly,  rat  Ric8A  also  exhibits  differential
GEF activity towards distinct G␣ proteins in vitro (Tall et al.,
2003),  and  our  work  with  GOA-1  and  GPA-16  provides  the
ﬁrst  evidence  that  such  differential  activity  occurs  in  a
physiological setting.

A second important difference is that RIC-8 is required for
normal  cortical  localization  of  GPA-16,  but  not  GOA-1.  We
found  also  that  RIC-8  is  needed  for  efficient  cortical
localization  of  GPB-1,  but  this  most  likely  reﬂects  the
requirement  of  RIC-8  for  GPA-16  cortical  localization,
because a diminution of GPB-1 is observed in gpa-16(RNAi)
embryos (data not shown). Importantly, we found in addition
that GPA-16 cortical localization is not altered in gpa-16(it143)
mutant embryos, despite the interaction of GPA-16 with RIC-
8 and GPR-1/2 being essentially abolished. This indicates that
the  requirement  of  RIC-8  for  GPA-16  cortical  localization  is
distinct  from  its  known  role  in  ensuring  interaction  between
G␣ proteins and GPR-1/2.

It will be interesting to investigate the mechanism by which
the  novel  requirement  of  RIC-8  for  GPA-16  cortical
localization is exerted. One possibility is suggested by the fact
that  myristoylation  and  palmitoylation  of  G␣ subunits  is
important 
(reviewed  by
Wedegaertner, 1998). In view of this, RIC-8 may be needed for

their  cortical 

localization 

for

lipid modiﬁcation of GPA-16. Alternatively, RIC-8 could help
fold GPA-16 to make it competent for cortical localization. Yet
an  alternative  possibility  is  suggested  by  the  fact  that  G␣
subunits in vertebrate cells can redistribute from the cortex to
the  cytosol  in  response  to  agonist  stimulation  (Allen  et  al.,
2005; Wedegaertner and Bourne, 1994). In this scenario, RIC-
8  may  be  a  negative  regulator  of  GPA-16  removal  from  the
cortex. Regardless of the underlying mechanism, our ﬁndings
uncover a novel function for RIC-8, that of ensuring cortical
localization of a G␣ protein. By extension, our results raise the
possibility  that  RIC-8  family  members  modulate  G-protein
signaling in other organisms in an analogous manner.

Activation mechanism of GPA-16 during asymmetric
cell division
Our  previous  work  suggested  a  model  for  the  activation
mechanism  of  GOA-1  in  which  RIC-8  GEF  activity  ﬁrst
generates  GOA-1·GTP,  after  which  the  intrinsic  GTPase
activity  of  GOA-1  converts  GOA-1  to  the  GDP-bound  form
capable of binding GPR-1/2 (Afshar et al., 2004). Our present
ﬁndings  suggest  a  simpler  model  for  GPA-16,  in  which
nucleotide  exchange  does  not  occur  prior  to  interaction  of
GPA-16  with  GPR-1/2  (Fig.  7).  As  Ric-8A  is  inactive  on
heterotrimer-complexed G␣·GDP (Tall et al., 2003), it is likely
that  RIC-8  acts  on  G␤␥-independent  GPA-16·GDP.  Because
RIC-8  does  not  exhibit  GEF  activity  towards  GPA-16,  we
propose that nucleotide exchange does not occur on GPA-16
prior  to  interaction  with  GPR-1/2  and  the  associated  protein
LIN-5. The GPA-16·GDP-GPR-1/2-LIN-5 complex may then
promote generation of pulling forces along astral microtubules.
Such a complex may still be associated with RIC-8, because
some  GPR-1/2  is  present  following  co-immunoprecipitation
with  RIC-8  antibodies  from  wild-type  embryonic  extracts
(Afshar et al., 2004). Spontaneous nucleotide exchange ensues,

Fig. 7. Working model of GPA-16 activation during asymmetric cell
division. RIC-8 binds to GPA-16·GDP, counteracting the formation
of the GPA-16/G␤␥ heterotrimer; this allows association of GPR-1/2
and LIN-5 with GPA-16. A complex of GPA-16·GDP-GPR1/2-LIN-
5 promotes generation of pulling forces on spindle poles. As some
GPR-1/2 co-immunoprecipitates with RIC-8 (Afshar et al., 2004),
RIC-8 may still be present in this complex, as illustrated. As RIC-8
does not exhibit GEF activity towards GPA-16, RIC-8-independent
nucleotide exchange may promote formation of GPA-16·GTP. Co-
immunoprecipitation experiments (see Fig. 5G) suggest that RIC-8
can associate with GPA-16·GTP, although this is not illustrated.
RGS-7 GAP activity promotes GTP hydrolysis and formation of
GPA-16·GDP and is thus is required for the activation cycle (Hess et
al., 2004).

probably accelerated by RGS-7 (Hess et al., 2004), terminates
the activation cycle.

Could the activation mechanism of GOA-1 in the embryo be
simpler  than  initially  envisaged  and  resemble  that  proposed
here  for  GPA-16?  Whereas  GPA-16  does  not  have  a  known
requirement outside of the germ line and the embryo, GOA-1
is also needed for synaptic transmission in the adult nervous
system  (Miller  and  Rand,  2000).  Therefore,  although
inactivation of ric-8 and of goa-1 yield opposite phenotypes in
the nervous system (Miller et al., 2000), possibly because RIC-
8 is also required for activation of the G␣q EGL-30, RIC-8 may
act as a GEF towards GOA-1 solely in the context of receptor-
dependent signaling. During receptor-independent activation in
the  one-cell  stage  embryo,  perhaps  mechanisms  that  do  not
invoke RIC-8 GEF activity are to be considered for both GPA-
16 and GOA-1.

Mechanism of partial redundancy: GOA-1 and GPA-
16 counter the effect of G␤␤␥␥ to ensure accurate
asymmetric spindle positioning
Our study contributes to understanding the partial redundancy
between  GOA-1  and  GPA-16.  We  ﬁnd  that  simultaneous
inactivation of the G␤ subunit GPB-1 and of either GOA-1 or
GPA-16 results in the same phenotype as that observed after
GPB-1  inactivation  alone.  Therefore,  GOA-1  and  GPA-16
become entirely redundant for asymmetric spindle positioning
following  G␤␥ inactivation.  These  ﬁndings  illustrate  the
importance  of  the  balance  between  G␣ proteins  and  G␤␥
during  receptor-independent  activation  of  heterotrimeric  G
proteins. This is reminiscent of the interplay between G␣ and
G␤␥ proteins in modulating receptor-dependent heterotrimeric
G protein signaling (for a review, see Gilman, 1987).

Our ﬁndings suggest that in wild-type C. elegans embryos,
the  presence  of  both  G␣ subunits  provides  substantial  G␣
molecules free from G␤␥, which can then associate in a RIC-
8-dependent  manner  with  GPR-1/2-LIN-5 
to  generate
appropriate pulling forces. When either GPA-16 or GOA-1 is
inactivated, less G␣ is available for interaction with GPR-1/2-
LIN-5,  resulting  in  lower  pulling  forces.  When  GPB-1  is
inactivated in addition, no G␤␥-dependent dampening occurs
and either GOA-1 or GPA-16 can alone sustain full generation
of  pulling  forces.  Interestingly,  this  is  the  case  in  embryos
simultaneously compromised for GPB-1 and GOA-1 (see Fig.
3; Table S1), despite GPA-16 protein levels being diminished
in the absence of GPB-1. However, we found that the bulk of
residual GPA-16 protein in gpb-1(RNAi) embryos is present at
the  cortex  (see  Fig.  1I),  which  appears  sufficient  to  recruit
GPR-1/2-LIN-5 and generate pulling forces in the absence of
GOA-1.

G␣␣ requirement during spindle positioning: beyond
C. elegans
Whereas  two  G␣ proteins  act  in  concert  in  one-cell  stage  C.
elegans embryos, a single G␣ that belongs to the G␣i class is
known  to  be  required  for  proper  spindle  orientation  in
Drosophila neuroblasts  and  sensory  organ  precursor  cells
(Schaefer et al., 2001). Although a second G␣ that belongs to
the G␣o class is expressed in these cells, it is not essential for
spindle orientation (Yu et al., 2003). However, overexpression
of  either  G␣o or  G␣i yields  identical  spindle  positioning
defects,  possibly  owing  to  depletion  of  free  G␤␥ (Yu  et  al.,

Research article

2003). Therefore, reminiscent of the situation in C. elegans, the
balance  between  G␣ proteins  and  G␤␥ is  also  crucial  in
Drosophila. However, the mechanisms of activation may differ
between the two species, as overexpression of G␣o or G␣i in
Drosophila results in a phenotype independent of the GoLoco
protein PINS (Yu et al., 2003). By contrast, G␤␥ inactivation
in  C.  elegans,  which  presumably  results  in  excess  free  G␣
proteins, results in a GPR-1/2-dependent phenotype (Tsou et
al., 2003).

The  requirement  for  G␣ proteins  and  their  regulators  in
spindle  positioning  extends  to  vertebrate  cells.  The  GoLoco
motif  and  RGS  domain-containing  protein  RGS14,  which
exerts both GDI and GAP activities towards G␣i/o subunits, is
crucial  for  spindle  assembly  in  the  mouse  zygote  (Martin-
McCaffrey et al., 2005). LGN, a mammalian GoLoco protein
more closely related to GPR-1/2 and PINS, is recruited to the
cell  cortex  through  association  with  a  G␣i  (Du  and  Macara,
2004). LGN also associates with the coiled-coil protein NuMA,
thus targeting it to the cell cortex, where it may function as a
spindle positioning effector. It has been suggested that GPR-
1/2  and  PINS  may  serve  an  analogous  function,  perhaps
targeting LIN-5 and Inscuteable, respectively (Du and Macara,
2004; Willard et al., 2004). If this view were correct, our work
would  indicate  that  both  GPA-16  and  GOA-1  are  needed  to
provide sufficient binding sites for GPR-1/2 to ensure efficient
LIN-5 cortical recruitment and generation of pulling forces.
