transport in spermatogenesis:
a driver of cellular differentiation?

Summary
This review explores the hypothesis that regulation of
nucleocytoplasmic shuttling is a means of driving dif-
ferentiation, using spermatogenesis as a model. The
transition from undifferentiated spermatogonial stem cell
to terminally differentiated spermatozoon is, at its most
basic, a change in the repertoire of expressed genes. To
effect this, the complement of nuclear proteins, such as
transcription factors and chromatin remodelling compo-
nents must change. Current knowledge of the nuclear
proteins and nucleocytoplasmic transport machinery re-
levant to spermatogenesis is consolidated in this review,
and their functional linkages are highlighted not only as a
means of regulating nuclear protein composition, but
also as a key mechanism regulating gene transcrip-
tion and hence cell fate. Through this, we hypothesize
that male germ cell differentiation is mediated through
regulation of nuclear transport machinery components,

Spermatogenesis: a sequence of
developmental steps
The production of fertile sperm relies on a precisely controlled
and orderly sequence of developmental steps. These steps
are initiated in the early embryo and are completed for the first
time only during puberty, setting the stage for the continuous
production of sperm, which occurs throughout adult life. A
small number of cells first observed in the mouse around
embryonic day 7 (E7) are allocated to the mammalian germline
prior to gastrulation. These primordial germ cells (Fig. 1)
proliferate and migrate to the developing gonad.
In the
presence of Y chromosome gene products produced by pre-
Sertoli cells of the male gonad,(1) they differentiate between
E11.5 and E12.5 into cells with the potential to form sperm,
termed gonocytes. Enveloped by Sertoli cells within semini-
ferous cords, gonocytes proliferate until approximately
E14.5(2) and then enter mitotic arrest.

Within two days after birth in the mouse, gonocytes re-enter
the cell cycle and migrate to the perimeter of the seminiferous
cord, becoming spermatogonia. Following a precise number of
cell divisions, these cells enter meiosis as spermatocytes.
Over the ensuing week, two successive nuclear divisions yield
haploid spermatids. These undergo the process of spermio-
genesis, which is characterized by repackaging of genomic
DNA, development of the acrosome, growth of the sperm tail,
and disassembly of
the transcriptional and translational
machinery.(3) The resulting sperm is essentially devoid of
cytoplasm and designed to carry its genetic cargo through the
male and female reproductive tracts to the egg. A renewing
population of spermatogonial stem cells maintains a con-
tinuum of developing and maturing germ cells. As the testis
develops, its germ cell population increases in complexity until,
in the adult testis, germ cells at all stages of differentiation,

from stem cell through to mature sperm, are present in tightly
controlled numbers and a highly organized arrangement. This
concurrent presence of germ cells at all stages of differentia-
tion within the seminiferous epithelium enables the simulta-
neous study of spermatogenic ontogeny,(3) thus making the
testis an ideal system for studying development.

Modulating gene expression through regulated
nucleocytoplasmic trafficking
like other developmental pro-
Because spermatogenesis,
cesses, embraces a sequential set of specific changes in cell
morphology and function, its progression requires the activa-
tion of appropriate transcription factors and delivery of nuclear
proteins to drive the required gene expression changes. We
hypothesize that, in addition to transcription factor regulation,
changes in the nuclear transport machinery also occur in
response to growth and differentiation stimuli. The following
section reviews selected current knowledge concerning these
factors and focuses on the most well-studied nuclear transport
mechanism, which relies on the importin family of proteins.

Key factors that

regulate specific stages of normal
spermatogenesis include hormones such as follicle stimulat-
ing hormone and testosterone, stem cell factor and members
of the transforming growth factor (TGF) b superfamily.(4) These
extracellular signals elicit changes in gene transcription that
alter access of specific transcription factors to DNA through
regulation of transcription factor transport into and out of the
nucleus.

The double-membrane structure of the nuclear envelope
restricts nuclear access, with the only portal for macromole-
cules being the nuclear pore complexes. The nuclear pore
complex comprises 40–50 distinct nucleoporin proteins.(5)
To pass through the nuclear pore, molecules greater than
50 kDa in size require active trafficking by nuclear transport
components, which typically recognise specific nuclear import
or export signals on these cargo proteins. In classical nuclear
import, nuclear localization signals (NLSs) on cargo proteins
are recognized by members of the importin protein super-
family, within which there are multiple a and b forms.(6) Nuclear
transport may be mediated by an importin b molecule alone,

(Fig. 2B), or by a heterodimer of importin a/b1 (Fig. 2A); in
the latter case, the importin a confers NLS recognition. The
complex of cargo and import proteins progresses through the
nuclear pore by transient interactions between the importin b
and nucleoporins. Once inside the nucleus, dissociation of the
complex requires binding of GTP-bound Ran to importin b
(see Fig. 2). Classical nuclear protein export (Fig. 2C) is
mechanistically similar to import, except that a separate set of
importin b family members serve as ‘‘exportins’’, recognizing
nuclear export signals. RanGTP is an integral component of
the export complex that moves through the nuclear pore
complex and is dissociated in the cytoplasm by Ran-GAP
(RanGTPase activating protein).(5)

There are multiple homologues of both importin a (6 in
humans)(7) and importin b (more than 20 in humans) in higher
eukaryotes. Table 1 illustrates the extent of similarity both
within the respective importin families, and across evolution,
of the 5 murine importin as (Table 1A) and selected repre-
the murine importin b family (Table 1B),
sentatives of
demonstrating the relatively greater amino acid conservation
between the importin as. Observations thus far(8–11) indicate
that different importin as have distinct properties in terms of
NLS recognition and nuclear transport efficiency for speci-
fic cargo proteins, as well as differential
tissue/cell-type
expression.(6,8–11) Importin as appear to differ in NLS-binding
specificity consistent with specialized transport roles; the
inducible transcription factor STAT1, for example, is recog-
nized by human Importin a1 and not by Importin a5,(8) whilst
NLSs that are recognized by Importin a3, such as that of the
DNA helicase Q1, appear
to require distinct N-terminal
flanking sequences.(10)

Very few members of the the importin b family have been
functionally characterized. These include importin b1, 2
(transportin), 3 (Ran binding-Protein 5),
importin 7 (Ran
binding-Protein 7), and the exportin CRM1, the latter being
responsible for nuclear export of leucine-rich nuclear export
signal-containing proteins. Functional redundancy within the
importin b family is exemplified by the NLS from ribosomal

protein rpL23a, which can be recognised by importin b1, 2, 3
and importin 7.(12)

While classical nuclear import and export accounts for
much of the transport across the nuclear envelope, other
importin- and Ran-independent nuclear import pathways have
been described. One example is the signaling molecule b-
catenin,(13) which has the ability to pass through the nuclear
pore complex in importin-independent
fashion by binding
directly to nucleoporins. Ran-independent nuclear import has
been reported under in vitro conditions of elevated Ca2þ
, and it
is dependent on the Ca2þ
-binding protein calmodulin.(14)
Intriguingly, a Ca2þ
-binding protein, calreticulin, appears to
mediate export of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA)
inhibitor and glucocorticoid receptor.(15,16) Exactly how these
potentially Ca2þ
signaling-responsive importin-/Ran-indepen-
dent nuclear import/export pathways interface with conven-
tional importin-/Ran-dependent pathways is unclear, but they
could conceivably be particularly important
in governing
nuclear access of transcription factors/chromatin remodeling
factors in developmental systems such as the testis, as
described below.

This review summarises current knowledge regarding
nuclear transport in the testis, with emphasis on selected
factors that mediate the key steps of the spermatogenic
process. We hypothesize that differentiation of
the male
gamete involves regulated changes in the nuclear transport
machinery in response to growth and differentiation stimuli,
and that these changes occur in parallel with critical, stage-
specific alterations in the transcription factors/chromatin
remodeling factors that are required within the nucleus.

Figure 2. Schematic representation of nuclear transport pathways. A: Nuclear import mediated by the importin a/b1 heterodimer. The
importin a/b1 heterodimer binds to an NLS-containing cargo protein via importin a. The importin–NLS-containing protein complex is
transported into the nucleus by importin b binding to hydrophobic repeat motifs within the nucleoporins of the nuclear pore complex. Cargo
release into the nucleoplasm is effected by binding of RanGTP to importin b which dissociates the importin–cargo complex. B: Nuclear
import mediated by cargo binding directly to importin b1/importin b homologues, such as importin b1. Transport occurs in analogous fashion
to A except that NLS recognition is not through importin a or a comparable adaptor. Experiments in somatic cell systems have shown that
importin b1 mediates nuclear import of Sry/SOX9,(25,26) CREB(55) and possibly Smad3; see Figure 1 for expression patterns of cargo in the
testis. C: Nuclear export mediated by importin b homologues. The nuclear export signal-containing cargo protein is recognized by an
importin b homologue (exportin), such as CRM1 and RanGTP, prior to transport through the nuclear pore complex, through importin
b/nucleoporin interactions (see A). Hydrolysis of GTP by Ran facilitated by RanGTPase-activating protein (RanGAP) dissociates the
exportin–RanGTP–nuclear export signal-containing cargo complex in the cytoplasm. Experiments in somatic cell systems have shown
that CRM1 mediates nuclear export of SOX9, Smad1 and cyclins D, A1, A2 and B1; see Fig. 1 for expression patterns in the testis. NPC,

Importin as indeed exhibit restricted tissue distributions.
Human importin a4, for example, makes up more than 1% of
protein in skeletal muscle, but is essentially absent from heart,
spleen and kidney.(17) In contrast, importin a2 is abundant
in heart, testis, skeletal muscle and ovary, and importin a3 is
the most highly expressed importin a in ovary.(18) Specific
mechanisms that regulate the nuclear transport process itself
include the modulation of
the importin–NLS interaction
through various NLS masking/enhancing mechanisms.(6)
Phosphorylation is a key modulator, with a number of
examples in developmental contexts. These include PKA site
enhancement of importin a/b-NLS interaction in the case of
nuclear import of the Drosophila transcription factor Dorsal,(19)
and cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) phosphorylation-depen-
dent prevention of Xenopus nuclear factor 7(20) nuclear import
by cytoplasmic retention.

While many details of the nucleocytoplasmic trafficking
machinery have been deciphered from in vitro analyses, we
have a limited understanding of how these function and
change in physiological systems during dynamic processes
such as growth and differentiation. In terms of testis develop-
ment, and of spermatogenesis in particular, key changes in
nuclear proteins required for normal development have been
defined. The remainder of this review summarises current

knowledge regarding nuclear transport in the testis, relating
this to factors that mediate the key steps of spermatogenesis.

Central role of Sry and SOX9 nuclear
transport in the fetal testis
Correct gender assignment in males is dependent on nuclear
transport of two key transcription factors. Expression of the Y-
chromosome-encoded Sry during E10.5–12.5 (in the mouse)
establishes the male fetal gonad as a testis.(21) Sry drives
differentiation of a subset of somatic cells into the Sertoli
lineage, the underpinning of male gonadal sexual differentia-
tion that transforms the bipotential primordial germ cells into
gonocytes. In the female gonad, the lack of Sry results in
default differentiation of somatic cells into granulosa cells
and germ cells into oogonia. Mutations in Sry account for
approximately 15% of human XY female sex reversal, empha-
sizing Sry’s critical role in ‘‘driving’’ male sex determination.(21)
Expression of the Sry-related transcription factor SOX9 is
upregulated in the male gonad and downregulated in the
female gonad at E11.5, with exclusive expression in Sertoli
cells by E12.5.(22) Mutations in SOX9 account for some cases
of human XY female sex reversal,(23) with SOX9 expression
sufficient to initiate the male phenotype even in the absence of
Sry. SOX9 instigates at least part of the cascade of trans-

cription events that mediate sex determination,(21) including
expression of anti-Mu¨ llerian hormone (AMH), which instigates
the regression of the female reproductive tract, and steroido-
genic factor-1 (SF-1), which is required for Leydig cell
development.

importance of nuclear export in sex determination. Collec-
tively, these experiments highlight the importance of regulated
nuclear localization of SRY, SOX9, and presumably a number
of other key chromatin remodeling and transcription factors, to
normal development of the fetal gonad.

Sry and SOX9 each possess a conserved high mobility
group (HMG) box domain that confers binding to and bending
of specific DNA target sequences to effect changes in gene
expression. Nuclear access of Sry and SOX9, critical to their
function, appears to be mediated by two distinct, evolutionarily
conserved, independently acting NLSs(24,25) that flank the
HMG box at either end. Of these, the C-terminal NLS mediates
nuclear import through a pathway of the type illustrated in
Figure 2B, requiring importin b1 and Ran,(24 –26) whereas no
importin has been identified as binding the N-terminal NLS; in
this has been shown to bind calmodulin.(27,28)

The importance of Sry nuclear localisation in sex determi-
nation has been demonstrated by examining the molecular
basis of four mutations found in human XY female, sex-
reversed patients, mapping to the Sry NLSs.(24) All
four
mutations resulted in reduced Sry nuclear accumulation, with
a C-terminal NLS mutation shown to cause impaired importin
b1 binding. Since certain sex-reversing mutations in either Sry
NLS result in reduced nuclear accumulation without affecting
other Sry functions, including in vitro DNA binding/bending
activity, both NLSs appear to be essential for complete nuclear
localisation of Sry. This is in turn required for normal initiation
of male gonadal development, presumably because a sharp
elevation in nuclear Sry activity is required to drive testis
differentiation.(29)

That SOX9 nuclear import is critical to sex determination is
implied by examination of a campomelic dysplasia-causing
mutation that also results in XY gonadal dysgenesis.(28)
Although the HMG domain mutation does not affect importin
b1 binding, it results in 50% impaired nuclear accumulation,
presumably attributable to altered calmodulin binding. To-
gether with the finding that calmodulin antagonists reduce
wild-type SOX9 nuclear import and transcriptional activation,
these results suggest that calmodulin is required for normal
nuclear accumulation and function of SOX9 and perhaps also
of Sry.

A role for SOX9 nuclear export

in mammalian sex
determination is suggested by the results of treating E10.5
female gonads with the CRM1-specific inhibitor leptomycin B.
This treatment resulted in increased SOX9 nuclear localiza-
tion(30) and the generation of Sertoli-like cells and partial cord-
like structures after 4 days.(30) Whether these results are
attributable to impaired nuclear export of SOX9, or to that of
other proteins critical to gonadal development could not be
concluded from these experiments, but the study highlights the

Cell cycle regulators in the testis
The eukaryotic cell cycle is controlled by cyclin–cdk com-
plexes. The G1 cyclins D, E and A, and their associated cdks
accumulate in the nucleus during G1 and initiate the expres-
sion of genes required for DNA synthesis.(31) A- and B-type
cyclins are expressed during G2, where cyclin B1, associated
with the cdk cdc2, forms the well-described M-phase promot-
ing factor (known as MPF) necessary for the G2–M transition.
Figure 3 depicts current knowledge of cyclin/cdk expression/
localisation in male germ cells, while descriptions of nuclear
import and export pathways have been identified by studies on
cell lines.

Cyclin–cdk activity is mediated by transcriptional, transla-
tional and post-translational regulation through phosphoryla-
tion and dephosphorylation, through interactions with specific
inhibitors, and by coexistence and dimerization.(31) Cyclin–
cdk complexes are required in the nucleus in sequential,
ordered fashion to drive mitotic progression (see Fig. 3). Timed
nuclear import, export and cyclin degradation are required for
cell cycle progression, and their perturbation can disrupt the
cell cycle.(32)

There are unique aspects of cell cycle regulation in germ
cells that are vital for fertility. The self-renewing germ cell
population relies on proliferation of primordial germ cells,
gonocytes and spermatogonia. The production of haploid
gametes through two meiotic divisions is restricted to
gametogenesis. As expected, many cell cycle proteins are
found in the testis, and their subcellular distribution is
consistent with their known roles in mitosis (Fig. 3). However,
certain cyclins show extended nuclear or cytoplasmic localiza-
tion in particular germ cells (see below), indicating that these
molecules may play roles independent of the cell cycle in
spermatogenesis and their functions may be regulated by
factors that govern their subcellular localization.

For example, the D-type cyclins play essential roles in
spermatogenesis, as demonstrated by the significantly re-
duced sperm counts in cyclin D2 knockout mice,(33) and by the
abnormal testicular development and severely reduced fertility
in mice lacking cdk4, a cyclin D partner.(34) In normally cycling
mitotic cells, the D-type cyclins generally accumulate in the
nucleus during G1 and are rapidly exported for degradation at
the onset of S-phase.(35,36) This nuclear export is enabled
through phosphorylation of cyclin D at threonine 286 by
nuclear glycogen synthase kinase 3b (GSK3b) and is medi-
ated by CRM1.(37) The nuclear and then cytoplasmic localiza-
tion of cyclins D1 and D3 in mitotic germ cells is consistent with
a role for these in cell cycle progression (Fig. 3).(38)

mechanisms, where known, of cyclin–cdk transport derived from somatic studies that may apply to male germ cells (see also Fig. 2).
Nuclear localization of cyclin D2 and B3 proteins independent of the cell cycle indicates these proteins have additional roles, perhaps relating
to differentiation, potentially through the action of as yet unidentified cofactors.(38,40,43–45,90–100) Potential but untested transport
mechanisms are indicated in shaded boxes and light/bold text indicates relative nuclear/cytoplasmic concentration of proteins.

Some observations of cyclin D expression in postmitotic
germ cells contrast what is seen in mitotic cells. Cyclin D2 has
been observed in the nuclei of pachytene spermatocytes, and
cyclin D3 has been reported in the cytoplasm of elongating
spermatids (Fig. 3).(38,39) Several factors are known to regu-
late D type cyclin protein localization, and these may also be
implicated in germ cell maturation. HSP-90, which enhances
nuclear accumulation of cyclin D, is co-localized with cdk4 in
spermatogonia,(38) and the cell cycle inhibitor p21Cip1, which
facilitates nuclear retention of cyclin D,(37) is co-localized with
cyclin D in pachytene spermatocytes.(40) The unusual cyclin D
localization in meiotic and postmeiotic germ cells could reflect
differences in the nuclear import or export machinery or traf-
ficking efficiency of p21Cip1 or HSP-90 in respective cell types.
Alternatively, the restricted expression pattern of GSK3b,(41)
required for phosphorylation, export and subsequent degra-
dation of cyclin D may dictate this unusual localization. In the

mouse, expression of GSK3b is detected by immunostaining
only in spermatogonia; the absence of GSK3b in later germ
cell stages may indicate that, in pachytene spermatocytes,
there is impaired cyclin D2 nuclear export, and delayed or no
cytoplasmic degradation of cyclin D3 in spermatids.(41)

Cell cycle progression offers further examples of potentially
unique subcellular localization mechanisms driving germ cell
maturation. In mitotic cells, cyclin A2 shuttles between the
cytoplasm and nucleus, with the prerequisite for nuclear
import being association with cdk1 or cdk2.(42) None of these
have an identifiable NLS, and the means of nuclear transport
remains unknown. In the testis, cyclin A and cdk1 are in
spermatogonia and show expected subcellular localization in
proliferating germ cells.(43)

Cyclin A1 is unique to the male germ line and essential
in mice for meiosis(44,45) and male fertility.(45) It is detected in
the nucleus in late pachytene to diplotene spermatocytes.

Expression profiles indicate that cdk2 is the likely partner for
cyclin A1. This is further supported by the cdk2 knockout
mouse phenotype,
in which spermatogonial proliferation
appears normal, but spermatogenesis is disturbed in meiosis,
with apoptosis resulting in germ cell
loss by the diplotene
stage.(46) This cdk2 knockout mouse offers a valuable
opportunity to investigate whether cyclin A1 nuclear import is
dependent on pre-complexation with cdk2 in meiotic cells,
similar to that reported for cyclin A2 and cdk1 in somatic cells. If
cyclin A1 is nuclear in early spermatocytes prior to germ cell
death in the cdk2 knockout mouse, this would indicate that the
nuclear import of this cyclin is regulated differently from that
reported for cyclin A2 in somatic cells.

Our understanding of how the subcellular localization of cell
cycle regulators in the testis affects their function is in part by
analogy from cell culture and other experimental systems.
However, the existing data indicate that alteration of the in-
tracellular transport of cyclins and other cell cycle proteins,
through modulation of the interacting molecules that influence
their localization to the nucleus or cytoplasm, may be critical to
driving the cell cycle changes that are central to the process of
spermatogenesis itself.

Oct4 in pluripotency and cancer
Regulation of gene expression during spermatogenesis
requires numerous transcription factors, many of which are
specific to male germ cells.(47) Their capacity to influence gene
expression during male germ cell differentiation will be
determined by their nuclear access.

The transcription factor Oct4, believed to be involved in
maintaining embryonic stem cells in an undifferentiated state,
is expressed in primordial germ cells, gonocytes and
spermatogonia, with predominantly nuclear localization (see
Fig. 1).(48) Upon commitment of spermatogonial stem cells to
differentiate, Oct4 protein becomes cytoplasmic and expres-
sion levels fall, with complete absence of expression by the
onset of meiosis.(49) Hence, preventing Oct4 nuclear export
may maintain spermatogonial stem cells in an undifferentiated
state. Determining the mechanisms regulating Oct4 nucleo-
cytoplasmic trafficking in spermatogonia, and developing
methods to manipulate this, may reveal
its key function in
spermatogenesis. For example, if prolonging Oct4 nuclear
expression can maintain spermatogonia in an undifferentiated
state,
this strategy could be applied to biotechnological
applications such as engineering of spermatogonial stem
cells as an avenue for animal transgenesis,(50) while undiffer-
entiated stem cells could provide therapeutic opportunities for
infertile couples where arrest of germ cell maturation leads to
an absence of spermatozoa. Expression of Oct4 in testicular
cancer cells suggests maintenance of Oct4 expression may be
central to tumorigenic status, so that driving Oct4 nuclear
export may conceivably eliminate or reduce the invasive
capacity of these cells.(51)

Unique modifiers for the cyclic AMP
response in spermatids
A group of transcription factors central to spermatogenesis
is responsive to the second messenger, cyclic AMP (cAMP),
with gene expression at several stages regulated by the
basic domain leucine zipper DNA-binding proteins cAMP-
responsive element (CRE) binding-protein (CREB) and CRE
modulator protein (CREM).(52) Alternative splicing and tran-
scription from distinct promoters produces various CREM and
CREB isoforms with different
transcriptional activator or
repressor properties. The CREB isoforms are ubiquitously
expressed, and their absence in knockout mouse models does
not produce specific testicular phenotypes,(53) implying they
are functionally redundant in this tissue. In contrast, CREM
isoform expression in male germ cells is much more dynamic
(see Fig. 1), with the male-germ-cell-specific isoforms,
CREMt and CREMy, transcribed from pachytene spermato-
cytes through to elongated spermatids. Their essential roles
as transcriptional activators of haploid genes is illustrated by
the phenotype of sterility in CREM knockout mice, arising from
apoptosis of early spermatids.(54)

Nuclear entry of CREB is mediated through a C-terminal
NLS that is recognized by importin b1,(55) but no NLS or
nuclear import mechanism has been defined for the related
CREM. CREB biological activity is not regulated by restricted
nuclear import,(56) but instead CREM and CREB activation is
controlled by the regulated nuclear import of interacting or
modifying factors. The latter include the PKA catalytic subunit,
phosphorylation by which activates transcriptional activity
of CREM and CREB in somatic cells(57) by enabling their
association with the co-activator CREB binding-protein
(CBP).(58)

In stark contrast to somatic cells, Activator of CREM in the
Testis (ACT) is a spermatid-specific protein that stimulates
transcriptional activity of unphosphorylated CREM,(59) and its
intracellular localization is modulated through a mechanism
unique to germ cells (Fig. 4A). The spermatid-expressed
kinesin, Kif17b, appears to function as a shuttling protein that
regulates subcellular localization of ACT. Kif17b overexpres-
sion in cell lines can maintain cytoplasmic localization of ACT
and prevent transcription of a reporter gene from CREM-ACT-
dependent promoters.(60) The involvement of these factors in
dynamic regulation of CREM activity specifically in haploid
male germ cells is indicated by the increasing levels of both
ACT and Kif17b in the nucleus of round spermatids between
stages I and VI, followed by their reduced nuclear expression
and increased cytoplasmic localization in the more mature
elongated spermatids. While Kif17b nuclear export is medi-
ated by CRM1, its import pathway is unknown. These studies
have revealed intracellular co-localization of ACTand Kif17b is
a likely mechanism by which CREM transcriptional activity is
governed uniquely in spermatids, instead of the phosphoryla-
tion-mediated regulation seen in somatic cells.

Figure 4. Dynamic subcellular localization of ACT and Kif17b during mouse spermatid development. The transition of the haploid germ
cell from round to elongate spermatid (see Fig. 1) is divided into a series of stages with defined characteristics of differentiation.(101)
Postulated regulatory mechanisms are based on co-transfection studies in COS and NIH3T3 cells, where Kif17b has been shown to be a
shuttling protein, in part through a CRM1-dependent nuclear export mechanism, which effects cytoplasmic localization of the normally
nuclear ACT by mediating its co-export.(60) During round spermatid stages I–VI, Kif17b is both cytoplasmic and nuclear whereas ACT
accumulates in the nuclear compartment. As the spermatid elongates from stage VIII, there is some cytoplasmic expression of ACT. During
this time, Kif17b is also seen in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. From stage IX–XI, there is increasing cytoplasmic expression of both ACT
and Kib17b and diminishing nuclear concentration. From stage XI, ACT is absent with Kif17b at the nuclear periphery. Co-localization of
ACT and Kif17b in spermatids presumably reflects a dependence of ACT nuclear-cytoplasmic localization on Kif17b. Kif17b is a versatile
protein, also having a role earlier in spermatogenesis. In pachytene spermatocytes, Kif17b associates with TB-RBP and TRAX to transport
mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Trafficking of this ribonucleoprotein entity is particularly complex, as the subcellular concentration
of TRAX, which contains an NLS, can modulate the subcellular localization of TB-RBP, which contains a CRM1 responsive nuclear export
signal.(61,62)

A further level of complexity in the regulation of CREM
activity arises from the translational inhibition of Kif17b and
CREM-regulated mRNAs in round spermatids (as in hippo-
campal neurons) when they are bound to the mouse testis–
brain RNA-binding protein, TB-RBP. In this context, mice
lacking TB-RBP show impaired growth, reduced fertility and
behavioural abnormalities, indicating the importance of this
gene product for many aspects of physiology.(61) TB-RBP itself
bears a nuclear export signal, but its localization appears to be
determined by the relative intracellular concentration of the
NLS-containing translin-associated factor X (TRAX).(62) In
male and female germ cells, both TB-RBP and TRAX are
nuclear at the pachytene stage of meiosis and cytoplasmic at
later stages. Thus TB-RBP and TRAX represent two additional
examples of proteins whose respective concentration in sub-

cellular compartments determines the expression of specific
germ cell mRNAs.

Smad shuttling: essential throughout
spermatogenesis
the TGFb superfamily signaling
Diverse components of
pathway, such as bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs),
TGF-b isoforms and activins, are required throughout sper-
matogenesis,
from the initial commitment of cells to the
germline through to production of mature spermatozoa.(4,63)
Their signals are mediated by the Smad transcription factor
proteins (Fig. 1). Upon TGF-b superfamily ligand binding to
membrane-bound receptor complexes, two C-terminal serine
residues of a Receptor-activated Smad (R-Smads; Smads 1,
2, 3, 5 and 8) are phosphorylated, inducing R-Smad complex

formation with Smad4 and their subsequent nuclear accumu-
lation. In association with other transcriptional activators or
repressors, this key step translates ligand stimulation at the
cell surface to changes in gene transcription.(63,64)

The dependency of germ cell lineage commitment in the
developing embryo on BMP signaling provides an intriguing
example of signaling input integration at the level of transcrip-
tional regulator nuclear accumulation. Knockout studies have
demonstrated the requirement for BMP4 and BMP8b and their
downstream signaling Smads, Smad1 and Smad5, for esta-
blishment of the primordial germ cell population.(65,66) In
addition to this, a gradient of BMP antagonists (follistatin and
cerebus) adjacent to the BMP-secreting cells is understood to
limit the population of cells that are able to transduce these
inductive BMP signals, thus restricting the number of cells that
commit to the germline to approximately 40. This ‘tussle’ of
signaling factors in the vicinity of cells that have the potential to
enter the germ cell lineage may translate into whether a cell
reaches a threshold level of Smad nuclear accumulation, and
hence determines whether the cell becomes a germ cell.
Smad-mediated gene transcription has also been directly
implicated at the onset of spermatogenesis in a recent in vitro
study.(67) BMP4 treatment of isolated spermatogonia resulted
in Smad4 and Smad5 nuclear translocation, and the subse-
quent
induction of c-kit expression indicates that Smad
transcriptional activity is required for this essential step in
spermatogonial differentiation.(67)

There exists the potential for adoption of different nuclear
import pathways depending on cell-specific nuclear trafficking
machinery and/or the phosphorylation state of the Smad
protein. Experiments in cell lines indicate that individual Smad
proteins employ nucleoporin-dependent mechanisms for
import and export that may be importin dependent or inde-
pendent. Further complexity was demonstrated when Smad2
and Smad3 were found to use different import machinery in
different cell types.(68 –71) In addition, while unphosphorylated
Smad proteins constantly shuttle between the nucleus and
cytoplasm, phosphorylation by activated receptors is likely to
modulate the import/export rate or the nuclear accumulation/
retention of Smads.(72) The co-factors that form transcriptional
complexes with Smad proteins are also likely to regulate Smad
nuclear import and export. Activated Smads oligomerize and
generally associate with Smad4 and/or other transcriptional
regulators, prior to import,(64,73) which may mask particular
NLS or nucleoporin-interacting sequences.

Cell-type- or developmental-stage-specific regulation of
Smad nuclear entry thus would appear to be modulated by
several pathways,
including complex formation and NLS
masking by phosphorylation or other mechanisms, as well
as regulated expression of nuclear import machinery compo-
nents. The vital influence of many TGFb superfamily members
on spermatogenesis underscores the potential of
these
mechanisms to drive spermatogenesis.

Proteolysis and nuclear transport:
Hedgehog signalling
Amongst the many transcription factors of interest during
spermatogenesis are the four members of
the glioma-
associated oncogene (Gli) family, downstream effectors of
the Hedgehog family signaling. The absence of desert
hedgehog (Dhh) in mice leads to sterility due to spermatogenic
failure at meiosis, while overexpression of human Gli1 in
mouse germ cells results in male sterility due to apoptosis of
spermatocytes.(74)
In Drosophila, proteolytic cleavage of
cubitus interruptus (Ci; the Drosophila Gli homolog) generates
a transcriptional repressor form, and this processing is central
to its nuclear import,(75) however the mechanism that under-
pins Ci transport, or that of the mammalian Gli proteins, is
unknown. Gli1 and Gli3 mRNAs have been detected specifi-
cally in mouse spermatogonia,(76) while GliS has been
observed in E14.5 cords of the developing testis.(77) Gli1
protein is distinctly cytoplasmic or nuclear, depending on the
stage of germ cell maturation(74)
(see Fig. 1), which
presumably reflects the differential regulation of its nuclear
transport by phosphorylation or interaction with cofactors.
Intriguingly, Liu et al.(78) reported that C-terminally truncated
Gli3 proteins can associate with non-activated Smads, a
relationship proposed by the authors to sequester Gli3 in the
cytoplasm and regulate Gli3 subcellular localization.(78) Given
the vital role that both the Smads and Gli proteins, and
regulated nuclear entry thereof, are known to play in sper-
matogenesis, the interaction of Gli3 and Smads, and its impact
on their respective nuclear import, warrants further study.

Role of specific nucleoporins in the testis?
In parallel with the developmental regulation of transcription
factors and chromatin remodeling factors during spermato-
genesis, regulated expression of nucleoporins and importin
family members may also influence gamete maturation. For
example, the Drosophila Nup154, homologous to rat Nup155,
is critical to fly gamete development in both sexes, being
required for cyst formation, meiotic progression in testes and
ovaries, egg chamber development and oocyte growth.(79)
The mammalian testis-specific nucleoporin BS-63 has been
detected at the nuclear envelope of human sperm and at
nuclear pore complexes in spermatids.(80) A portion of the BS-
63 coding sequence used in a yeast 2-hybrid screen identified
Ran and importin b2 as binding partners, in addition to the AT-
hook domain chromatin remodeling factor, aF10, which is
known to be expressed in postmeiotic germ cells.(81) Although
no specific function has been established for BS-63 in the
testis, these data suggest that factors such as aF10 may
access the nucleus through direct interaction with nucleopor-
ins, in analogous fashion to b-catenin and the Smads (see
above), with BS-63 serving as a critical docking site in the
nuclear pore complex in haploid germ cells.

The nuclear pore-associated protein Npap60 is over
10 times more abundant in the rat testis than in other tissues
and has been reported to undergo changes in its association
with the nuclear envelope and nucleoplasm during meiotic and
postmeiotic germ cell development.(82) In analogous fashion to
nucleoporins, Npap60 may alter nuclear pore function to
modulate nuclear entry of particular nuclear factors or trans-
port of complexes passing through the pore, thus contributing
integrally to germ cell differentiation.

Critical role of specific importin alphas
in the testis
The great number of importins in mammals and their con-
served structures suggests that there are opportunities for
both functional redundancy and tissue specificity of function
(see Table 1). It has been through studies of non-mammalian
species that steps vital to gamete formation dependent on
nuclear transport proteins have been identified.

All three C. elegans importin as (referred to as IMA-1, IMA-
2 and IMA-3) have been implicated in germline maturation and
other developmental events, but only IMA-3 appears to be
related to the importin as of other species (see Table 1). IMA-1
and IMA-2 are germline-specific, whereas IMA-3 is expressed
in both somatic and germ cells in adult nematodes. All three
IMAs exhibit gender-specific expression patterns.(83,84) Abro-
gation of
IMA-3 expression using RNAi blocks germline
passage through meiosis, indicating that IMA-3 is required
for meiosis in C. elegans; IMA-1 and IMA-2 cannot compen-
sate for its absence. The 92% embryonic and larval lethality of
ima-3(RNAi) F1 progeny indicates that IMA-3 is required for
many other aspects of nematode development.(83) Reduction
of IMA-2 transcripts dramatically affected germ cells in 25% of
injected hermaphrodite animals,(84) with their F1 progeny
exhibiting 97% embryonic lethality due to severe aneuploidy,
disorganized chromatin masses between spindle poles and
incomplete nuclear envelope formation. These results under-
score the crucial role of IMA-2 in meiosis, but whether the
defects reported stem from the lack of transport of a particular
nuclear protein, or are related to a role in chromosome
segregation or nuclear envelope formation, is not clear.

The three importin as in Drosophila also show discrete
spatiotemporal expression patterns during spermatogenesis
(Fig. 5).(85) The Drosophila importin-a2D14 mutant displays
fertility defects in both males and females.(86) Occlusion of the
ring canals that connect the nurse cells and oocytes results in
deficient transfer from the nurse cells to the oocytes and
female sterility. Male flies homozygous for importin-a2D14
exhibit reduced fertility, associated with production of defective
sperm.(86) The generation of offspring from some of these
mutants probably reflects functional redundancy amongst
importin a homologues during spermatogenesis. Consistent
with this idea, transgenic expression of either importin a1 or a3
can partially restore fertility in male importin-a2D14 mutants.(87)

Review articles

There appears to be no such redundancy with respect to
importin a2 in the female, where importin-a2D14 mutants are
completely sterile, and importin a1 or a3 cannot complement
the sterile phenotype,(87) indicating that importin a2 serves a
unique and vital role in oogenesis.

While these studies indicate vital roles for certain importin
as in lower eukaryotes in development and germline proges-
sion, no essential role for importin bs has been identified
specific to the germline, as opposed to that observed in
embryogenesis. Drosophila importin b1 (Ketel), for example,
is a maternally derived protein essential for embryogenesis,
as shown by the KetelD dominant-negative mutation where
the presence of the mutant protein in the egg cytoplasm
causes microtubule disorganization and failure of chromo-
some segregation.(88) These and other abnormalities lead to
the absence of cleavage nuclei, thus terminating embryogen-
esis well before tissue differentiation. These data indicate that
a variety of nuclear transport pathways and components
underpin events at different developmental stages.

Regulated nucleocytoplasmic transport
as a driver of development?
Regulated and rapid entry into the nucleus is accomplished, at
least partially, through the actions of importins, and this review
has illustrated how normal and aberrant nuclear transport can
govern developmental events, including gametogenesis. The
importance of correct nuclear import of SRY and SOX9 in
mammalian sex determination and testicular development has
been reviewed, and this provides a powerful example of the
clinical relevance of this concept. We have also highlighted
evidence indicating that regulated expression of nuclear
transport machinery components can influence, if not deter-
mine, the pathway of cellular differentiation. The unique model
of spermatogenesis provides an elegant platform for further
investigation of this concept, as critical nuclear factors are
required for well-defined stages of differentiation. The ex-
amples of TRAX/TB-RBP and CREM/Act/Kif7 reveal that
multiple levels of regulation exist to mediate the timely delivery
of transcription factors and proteins into the nucleus.

The potential to exploit this knowledge is enhanced as our
awareness of key regulatory switches and the corresponding
transport machinery expands. Already it is clear that develop-
mental switches govern progression through spermatogen-
esis, with nuclear transport offering new avenues for exploring
the basis for abnormal spermatogenesis and causes of infer-
tility; ultimately this knowledge can be applied to generating
new contraceptive strategies and enable the manipulation of
cell differentiation in vitro for biotechnological applications.
The ability to halt male germ cell maturation may arise from
manipulations of the nuclear transport machinery, and both
spermatogonia and postmitotic germ cell targets would pre-
sent attractive targets. The capacity to drive cellular differ-
entiation into a particular lineage remains an important focus
