Abstract RNA interference (RNAi) is a form of gene silencing
induced by double stranded RNA (dsRNA) that is processed into
short
interfering RNAs (siRNAs). RNAi can induce both
post-transcriptional and transcriptional gene silencing. In Cae-
norhabditis elegans, there are several distinct pathways where
post-transcriptional or/and transcriptional RNAi mechanisms
are involved. RNAi in C. elegans is also systemic and heritable.
This review will discuss RNAi related pathways, features of
RNAi in C. elegans and possibilities of endogenous gene regula-
tion by RNAi.

1. Introduction

RNAi is one of the most widely used tools in cell biology.
The widespread use of RNAi makes it easy to forget that it
has been applied to mammalian cells only four years ago [1]
and that it was ﬁrst discovered and characterized in Caeno-
rhabditis elegans [2]. In fact, C. elegans researchers have been
using RNAi as a tool for several years before it was named
RNAi. Guo and Kemphues [3], found that injection of anti-
sense RNA causes dramatic downregulation of gene expres-
sion in the C. elegans germline. Curiously, sense RNA
preparations were as eﬃcient as antisense [3]. Studies of this
new phenomenon were carried out by Andy Fire, Craig Mello
and their colleagues. They found it to be distinct from anti-
sense inhibition of gene expression and named it RNA interfer-
ence (RNAi) [2]. They established important characteristics of
RNAi: (a) it is induced by double-stranded RNA, (b) the eﬀect
of RNAi is systemic, and (c) RNAi is heritable. This discovery
encouraged RNAi studies in many systems and also helped to
reveal connections
to post-transcriptional gene silencing
(PTGS) in plants [4] and fungi [5] and to the endogenous reg-
ulation by miRNAs [6], all of which were discovered earlier.

At present, the power of C. elegans genetics combined with
molecular analysis of short RNAs allows discrimination be-
tween diﬀerent RNAi-related phenomena within the organism.
It is now clear that along with the classical RNAi pathway
genes, activated in response to the exogenous dsRNA [7], there

are separate but overlapping pathways of genes required for
silencing of transposable elements and tandem arrays in the
germline. The classical RNAi pathway and RNAi-related
pathways which are responsible for silencing of repetitive ele-
ments, namely, tandem array silencing [7,8], co-suppression
[9,10] and transposon silencing [11] are reviewed here.

in C. elegans RNAi

RNAi is systemic in worms and plants, but not in other
organisms. Remarkably,
is heritable
[2,12]. The eﬀect can be maintained for three or more genera-
tions and can be transmitted with the single sperm [12]. So far,
this phenomenon has not been observed in other organisms.
RNAi inheritance and the genetic pathway required for sys-
temic RNAi are discussed further in this review.

In C. elegans, dsRNA can induce both post-transcriptional
[13] and transcriptional gene silencing [14,15] (PTGS and
TGS, respectively), the latter being documented only for trans-
genes so far. In addition, there are pathways antagonizing clas-
sical RNAi in C. elegans [16–18], presumably by competition
for shared components or intermediates. This implies existence
of endogenous gene regulation by RNAi-related processes dis-
tinct from miRNAs, which is further supported by the cloning
of endogenous siRNAs. Pathways antagonizing RNAi and the
possibility of endogenous gene regulation by RNAi are dis-
cussed in the last two sections.

2. Classical RNAi pathway

The original studies of RNAi were performed by injecting
dsRNA into the gonad or the body cavity of the worms and
examining the phenotypes in the next generation [2]. Lisa Tim-
mons and Andy Fire [19] developed a technique for feeding
worms bacteria expressing dsRNA and Tabara and Mello
[20] showed that simply soaking worms in dsRNA is also eﬀec-
tive in producing knock-down phenotypes. These advances in
introducing dsRNA allowed large-scale screens for RNAi deﬁ-
cient mutants [7] and also led to the production of genome
wide collections of RNAi feeding constructs and genome-wide
RNAi based screens [21].

The ﬁrst mutants in the RNAi pathway identiﬁed by Tabara
and Mello [7] were called RNAi deﬁcient (rde). These original
screens were aimed at identifying of viable mutants, resistant
to RNAi targeting pos-1, a gene important for viability. There-
fore, it is not surprising that the ﬁrst rde mutants identiﬁed in
C. elegans did not have any signiﬁcant developmental abnor-
malities. The ﬁrst phenotypes reported for rde mutants were
those of mutator genes responsible for silencing transposable
elements in the germline [7]. In mutator (mut) mutants

transposons get mobilized in the germline, inserting themselves
in various genes and causing increased rate of mutations.
Many mutator genes identiﬁed by Plasterk and colleagues
[11,22–24] turned out to be important for RNAi.

Heritability of RNAi in C. elegans allowed experiments that
helped in ordering the rde mutants in the pathway [12]. While
some genes, like rde-1 and rde-4, were important for produc-
tion of the heritable RNAi component, but dispensable there-
after, others, like rde-2 and mut-7, were not needed for RNAi
initiation but were required for the response to the heritable
RNAi factor (Fig. 1). Studies of PTGS in plants and molecular
analysis of RNAi in vitro and in Drosophila tissue culture iden-
tiﬁed important
interfering
RNAs (siRNAs), which most likely correspond to the heritable
factor in C. elegans. Thus, the RNAi pathway started to be
viewed as a two-step process consisting of siRNA production
from long dsRNA and their subsequent utilization [1]. Studies
in other systems showed that mature mRNA gets degraded in
response to RNAi by an initial endonucleolytic cleavage event
and subsequent mRNA destruction by exonuclease, suggesting
a mechanism by which gene expression is reduced [1] (see re-
view by Hammond in this issue).

intermediates in RNAi, short

protein, Rde-4, were found in the complex with the only
C. elegans Dicer, Dcr-1, and a conserved DexH box helicase,
Drh-1 [25] (Fig. 1). It was shown that the dsRNA speciﬁc
RNase III family ribonuclease Dicer is responsible for process-
ing dsRNA into siRNAs [1] (see reviews by Hammond and
Hutvagner in this issue). Structural studies of PAZ-PIWI pro-
teins have revealed that PAZ domain is important for siRNA
interaction [26] while the PIWI domain, in some proteins of
this family, can perform endonucleolytic cleavage of mRNA
targeted by siRNAs [1] (see review by Hammond in this issue).
It was surprising that Rde-1 was only required for the ﬁrst step
in RNAi since, in other organisms, PAZ-PIWI or Argonaute
proteins are found associated with the downstream RNAi
pathway complex – the RNA induced silencing complex
(RISC) (see review by Hammond in this issue). However, there
are around 25 PAZ-PIWI homologs in C. elegans [7] many of
which are likely to act redundantly in the RNAi pathway, most
likely as components of RISC. For example, one of the family
members, Ppw-1 is required for eﬃcient RNAi in the germline
[27]. The role of the Rde-1 protein in the Dicer complex might
be to bind to processed siRNAs and bring them to the appro-
priate downstream complex (Fig. 1).

the PAZ-PIWI family protein, Rde-1, and the dsRNA binding

Several studies of the second, downstream, step of the RNAi
pathway have been reported. Biochemical fractionation identi-

Fig. 1. Schematic representation of RNAi mechanisms in C. elegans. (A) The classical RNAi pathway is induced by exogenous dsRNA that is
processed into siRNAs by the Dicer complex containing Dicer, the dsRNA binding protein Rde-4, the PAZ-PIWI protein Rde-1 and the Dicer
related helicase Drh-1. Rde-1 is shown bound to siRNAs bringing them to the next step in the RNAi pathway. Eri-1 antagonizes RNAi by degrading
siRNAs. A complex containing Mut-7 and Mut-8/Rde-2 mediates transition between the two steps in the RNAi process. At the downstream step the
RISC complex containing a single-stranded siRNA, the PAZ-PIWI protein, Tsn-1 and Vig-1 is shown targeting a mature mRNA. At the same time
another complex containing a RdRP (either Rrf-1 or Ego-1) and possibly Rde-3 is engaged in the target-dependent ampliﬁcation of the dsRNA. A
similar complex containing Rrf-3 is shown amplifying its target and creating competition to RdRP complexes involved in RNAi. (B) Tandem array
silencing is induced by dsRNA arising from bi-directional transcription at the locus. dsRNA gets processed by a complex likely containing Dicer, a
PAZ-PIWI protein, a dsRNA binding protein and a helicase. A PAZ-PIWI protein is shown bound to the siRNA after processing. siRNAs are likely
to be used as primers by RdRP complexes working on the nascent transcript. siRNA complexes are likely to induce H3K9 and H3K27 methylation at
the transgenic array and initiate heterochromatin formation. Long dsRNA produced from the array also serves a substrate for ADARs that
successfully compete with the RNAi machinery in the soma, but not in the germline.

ﬁed some RISC components in C. elegans, which are similar
to those in Drosophila and mammals [28]. These include
C. elegans homologs of VIG (Vig-1) and Tudor-SN (Tsn-1),
a protein containing a Tudor domain and ﬁve staphylococ-
cal/micrococcal nuclease domains (Fig. 1). Presumably, Tu-
dor-SN is the RISC exonuclease, but it was also found in a
signiﬁcant amount in the nucleus of C. elegans [28]. Since
RISC functions in the cytoplasm, the latter ﬁnding suggests
a role for Tudor-SN in additional complexes. The DEAD
box helicase Mut-14 also acts downstream in the RNAi path-
way and is another possible RISC component in C. elegans
[24]. mut-14 is the only mutant in C. elegans not required for
the production or accumulation of siRNAs during RNAi
in vivo, which strongly suggests its downstream role in the
pathway.

A complex containing Mut-7 and Rde-2/Mut-8 is likely to
represent an intermediate step between Dicer complex and
RISC in the C. elegans RNAi pathway (Fig. 1). Mut-7 and
Rde-2/Mut-8 act downstream of Rde-1 and Rde-4 and are re-
quired for siRNA accumulation in vivo [23]. Mut-7 contains a
helicase and 30–50 exonuclease domain while Rde-2/Mut-8 has
a homolog in C. briggsae, but no homologs in other species.
Upon introduction of dsRNA into worms, the Mut-7 contain-
ing complex increases in size, indicating the recruitment of
additional factors [23].

RNA-dependent-RNA polymerases (RdRPs) are essential
for RNAi in C. elegans. Two RdRP genes have been implicated
in this process. The germline speciﬁc RdRP gene, ego-1, is
required for germline gene targeting by RNAi [29], while rrf-1
is required for RNAi in the somatic tissues [30]. Action of
RdRPs is required for the accumulation of siRNAs during
RNAi in vivo. Interestingly, only antisense siRNAs accumulate
[24] and their accumulation is dependent on the presence of the
target gene (Grishok and Mello, unpublished results). It is
thought that primary siRNAs produced by the Dcr-1 complex
act as primers for RdRP using the mature mRNA as a template
(Fig. 1). As a result, dsRNA is produced again, which then
serves a substrate for Dicer. This model is consistent with most
of the existing data, although it cannot explain why only anti-
sense siRNAs accumulate during RNAi in C. elegans. Since
RISC contains only one strand of the siRNA, it is possible that
non-functional RISC complexes are eﬃciently eliminated.

The most recently cloned rde gene is rde-3 [31]. It encodes a
conserved protein of the polymerase b nucleotidyltransferase
superfamily. Some rde-3 mutant alleles alter conserved resi-
dues within the nucleotidyltransferase domain, indicating that
catalytic polymerase activity might be essential for Rde-3 func-
tion. Proteins with polymerase function related to Rde-3 in-
clude poly(A) polymerases (PAP) and 20–50 oligoadenylate
synthase (OAS). The latter is upregulated in response to
dsRNA during the interferon response in mammalian cells.
Another interesting member of this family, the ﬁssion yeast
protein Cid12, has been recently implicated in RNAi-induced
chromatin silencing and is present in the complex with RdRp
[32]. It is possible that Rde-3 functions in a complex with
RdRP and is important for the ampliﬁcation step during
RNAi in C. elegans [31] (Fig. 1). Consistent with this possibil-
ity, siRNAs do not accumulate in rde-3 mutants.

Interestingly, some genes with chromatin related function,
such as zfp-1, gﬂ-1, mes-3, mes-4 and mes-6 have been impli-
cated in RNAi targeting endogenous genes in C. elegans [31],
leading to speculations about a transcriptional component in

conventional RNAi. When these genes were targeted by
RNAi, this reduced the eﬃciency of subsequent RNAi target-
ing of additional genes [31]. A list of genes aﬀecting RNAi in
C. elegans, produced as a result of a similar genome wide
RNAi analysis, also includes a number of chromatin factors
[33]. These results suggest a possible transcriptional role for
RNAi in targeting endogenous genes, however, no molecular
data exist to support this. Therefore, the role of identiﬁed
chromatin factors in RNAi might be indirect.

3. Systemic RNAi in C. elegans

The systemic nature of RNAi in C. elegans is one of the most
fascinating features of this process. Early RNAi experiments
were performed by injecting dsRNA into the germline of her-
maphrodites, a technique similar to that established for DNA
transformation. However, Mello and colleagues [2] observed
that dsRNA mistakenly injected into the body cavity, instead
of the germline, still induced RNAi. Injections into the intes-
tine seemed to be most eﬀective. Spreading of the injected
dsRNA into most cells of the worm, including the germline, al-
lows inheritance of the injected material and establishment of
the RNAi eﬀect in the progeny of the injected worms [2].
The progeny are usually more aﬀected by RNAi than their par-
ents. However,
it seems that in the progeny RNAi eﬀect
spreads less eﬃciently as it is rarely inherited further. Cases
when RNAi is heritable beyond F1 generation occur exclu-
sively when genes expressed in the germline are targeted [12].
Since there is a target mRNA dependent ampliﬁcation step
during RNAi in C. elegans [30], siRNAs accumulate in tissues
where the target genes are expressed. Therefore, it is easy to
imagine that if a muscle-speciﬁc gene is targeted, secondary
siRNAs accumulate in the muscle, and if a germline-speciﬁc
gene is targeted, secondary siRNAs accumulate in the germ-
line. In the latter case, siRNAs are more likely to be transmit-
ted to the next generation.

The lack of heritability beyond F1 generation of RNAi tar-
geting somatic genes, despite the existence of ampliﬁcation
mechanism for siRNA accumulation, argues against eﬃcient
systemic spread of siRNAs and for the spread of long dsRNA.
Accordingly, it was observed that injection of siRNAs in the
gonad of C. elegans is eﬃcient in inducing RNAi when germ-
line-speciﬁc genes are targeted, but produces a minimal eﬀect
on genes expressed in other tissues of the injected animal
[24]. C. elegans hermaphrodites have two isolated gonads.
Injection of siRNAs aﬀecting embryonic development into
only one of the gonads lead to the death of 50% of laid em-
bryos [24], consistent with the lack of eﬃcient siRNA transport
to the other gonad. The fact that dsRNA injected rde-4 mutant
worms when crossed to wild type males can transmit the RNAi
eﬀect to their progeny [7] also supports the idea that long
dsRNA, but not siRNAs, are transported since Rde-4 protein
is required for siRNA production. This type of experiment also
illustrated that many classical RNAi pathway genes, like rde-1
and rde-4, were not required for RNAi transport.

As was mentioned earlier, RNAi feeding and soaking meth-
ods allowed large scale screens for RNAi deﬁcient mutants.
These types of screens did not discriminate between mutants
aﬀecting dsRNA transport or other downstream steps in the
pathway. The Hunter and Plasterk groups designed screens
speciﬁcally looking for mutants in systemic RNAi, calling

5935

them sid (systemic RNAi defective) [34] and rsd (RNAi spread-
ing defective) [35], respectively. Both groups identiﬁed a gene,
sid-1/rsd-8, encoding a transmembrane protein as an important
component of systemic RNAi. It was shown that Sid-1 func-
tions cell autonomously and is expressed in cells with direct
environmental contact [34]. By expressing Sid-1 in Drosophila
cells, Feinberg and Hunter [36] demonstrated that Sid-1 func-
tions by facilitating passive cellular uptake of dsRNA and that
longer dsRNAs are transported into the cells more eﬃciently.
Some of the other rsd mutants that have been cloned suggest
that endocytosis may be involved in the internalization of
dsRNA [35]. Rsd-2 encodes a large novel protein that interacts
with Rsd-6, a Tudor domain containing protein. Rsd-3 en-
codes a protein with epsin N-terminal homology domain
(ENTH) that is frequently found in vesicle traﬃcking proteins.
Rsd-3 is expressed in cells actively engaged in endocytosis in C.
elegans and it has been proposed that transported dsRNA is
contained within endocytic vesicles. Interestingly, it has been
observed that dsRNA expressed from a transgene in one tissue
of the worm is often not eﬃcient in eliciting RNAi response in
another, while exogenously provided dsRNA spreads very eﬃ-
ciently [37]. One explanation proposed by Tijsterman and col-
leagues is that exogenously provided dsRNA is packaged in
the endocytic vesicles while endogenous dsRNA is not.

The systemic nature of RNAi in C. elegans likely reﬂects its
role in antiviral defense. Although no nematode viruses have
been isolated so far, recent work from several groups established
viral replication systems in C. elegans based on insect Flock
house virus (FHV) and mammalian vesicular stomatitis virus
(VSV) and demonstrated an antiviral role of the RNAi pathway
in C. elegans (Lu et al. and Wilkins et al., Nature in press).

4. RNAi and silencing of repetitive elements in C. elegans

Repetitive elements are often silenced by transcriptional and
post-transcriptional mechanisms in various organisms. In C.
elegans, the most commonly used transformation technique
relies on the injected DNA spontaneously forming repetitive
arrays that are inherited as extragenic elements. Expression
of transgenes organized in repetitive arrays is often diminished.
This eﬀect is most dramatic in the germline. Kelly and col-
leagues [8] showed that reducing the repetitive nature of the
transgenic arrays by co-injection of genomic DNA enhances
germline transgene expression. They also demonstrated that
chromatin eﬀects are involved in the maintenance of transgene
silencing as mutations in the Polycoumb Group related
proteins Mes-2 and Mes-6 relieve silencing [38]. It has been
shown further that histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9) di- and tri-meth-
ylation, a modiﬁcation associated with heterochromatin and
recognized by heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), is found on
extrachromosomal transgenic fragments [39] (Fig. 1). The
C. elegans HP1 homolog, hpl-2, has also been implicated in
transgene silencing in the germline [40].

Early genetic analysis of the RNAi pathway in C. elegans
indicated that some RNAi pathway mutants, namely mut-7
and rde-2, cause partial de-silencing of transgenic arrays at ele-
vated temperature, suggesting a possible connection between
RNAi related processes and transcriptional silencing [7]. This
connection has been revealed and explored much further in
ﬁssion yeast and plants. It has been shown that silencing of
the repetitive centromeric repeats in Schizosaccharomyces

pombe, including H3K9 methylation and HP1(Swi6) localiza-
tion, is dependent on multiple RNAi pathway genes and is
associated with siRNA production from the bi-directionally
transcribed centromeric dsRNA [41] (see review by Moazed
in this issue). A similar mechanism is likely to be responsible
for the silencing of repetitive transgenic arrays in the germline
of C. elegans. One of the diﬀerences between the two systems is
that silencing of the germline arrays in C. elegans, once estab-
lished, seems to be stably maintained at the chromatin level
and not dependent on the initiating RNAi factors.

Another phenomenon, related to repetitive elements silenc-
ing, is co-suppression. During co-suppression, an endogenous
gene gets silenced along with the corresponding multiple trans-
genes that cause the eﬀect. The transgene silencing in the germ-
line described above, although very potent,
is not often
associated with a strong co-suppression eﬀect. Therefore, there
might be additional components or mechanisms underlying co-
suppression. Co-suppression in C. elegans has been described
for germline genes and was shown to be dependent on the
mut-7 and rde-2 genes [9,10] (Fig. 1), functioning downstream
of dcr-1, rde-1 and rde-4 in the RNAi pathway. Interestingly,
rde-1 and rde-4 are not required for co-suppression or germline
transgene silencing, although they are absolutely required for
RNAi directly initiated by dsRNA. It has been proposed that
diﬀerent initial stimuli initiate various RNAi related pathways
with diﬀerent PAZ-PIWI proteins possibly distinguishing the
pathways. A large number of genes aﬀecting co-suppression
in the germline of C. elegans, co-suppression defective, cde,
have recently been identiﬁed in a genome wide RNAi based
screen [15]. Genes identiﬁed include those involved in RNA
and protein metabolism, as well as genes encoding chromatin
and transcription related proteins. Interestingly, some cde gene
products, such as the P granule component, Pgl-1, and the
RNA helicase A, Rha-1, which is implicated in chromatin reg-
ulation [42], also aﬀected RNAi in the germline in C. elegans.
Conversely, the known RNAi pathway gene rde-3, which en-
codes a polymerase b nucleotidyltransferase superfamily pro-
tein, along with another member of this family are among
the new cde genes. Molecular analysis of the co-suppression
process indicated that both transcriptional and post-transcrip-
tional mechanisms are responsible for this type of silencing.

Naturally occurring repetitive elements in C. elegans include
transposable elements and silencing of Tc1 transposons was
the ﬁrst natural function attributed to the RNAi pathway
[11]. However, the strongest RNAi pathway mutants rde-1
and rde- 4 do not aﬀect this silencing [7]. Transposon silencing
in the germline in C. elegans is thought to occur primarily on
the post-transcriptional
level. Fifty-four nucleotide long
dsRNA associated with silencing and corresponding to Tc1
terminal inverted repeats (TIR repeats) has been detected as
well as siRNAs corresponding to TIR and other regions of
Tc1 transposon [43]. Cloning of endogenous short RNAs also
yielded several siRNAs corresponding to Tc1 [44]. Twenty-se-
ven genes aﬀecting transposon silencing have been identiﬁed in
an RNAi screen [22]. The mut-16 gene found in this screen cor-
responded to ﬁve alleles identiﬁed in the forward genetic
screens for mutants causing transposon mobilization as well
as to rde- 6 (ne322), a mutant deﬁcient in RNAi [22]. Co-sup-
pression is also aﬀected in the mut-16 mutant background [15].
Other genes identiﬁed in the screen include ppw-2, a gene
encoding PAZ-PIWI domain protein, pab-1, which encodes a
poly(A) binding protein, several
factors related to RNA

5936

metabolism and several nuclear components [22]. This indi-
cates that some transcriptional regulation might be involved
in this process.

Although classical RNAi pathway genes, rde-1 and rde-4 are
not required for repeat-induced silencing processes in the
germline, they have been implicated in transcriptional silencing
initiation of repetitive transgenes in the soma of C. elegans
[14]. It has been shown that silencing of transgenic arrays in
the somatic tissues can be initiated by feeding worms dsRNA
corresponding to the coding region of the transgene together
with dsRNA corresponding to vector sequences present both
in the transgenic arrays in the cells of the worm and in the feed-
ing vector. Transcriptional silencing in this system was indi-
cated by reduced levels of RNA polymerase II at
the

transgenic array and decreased transgene pre-mRNA levels.
This inducible silencing was dependent on the classical RNAi
pathway genes and on chromatin factors, such as the HP1
homolog, hpl-2, the Polycomb related gene sop-2, potential his-
tone deacetylases and methyltransferases.

5. Pathways opposing RNAi in C. elegans

The RNAi process in C. elegans is modulated by factors lim-
iting its eﬃciency. Therefore, mutations aﬀecting such factors
lead to enhanced RNAi in the mutant backgrounds. Mutants
in the gene encoding the putative RdRP, rrf-3, were the ﬁrst
ones where an enhanced RNAi response was demonstrated

[16]. The rrf-3 mutant background shows a stronger RNAi re-
sponse when genes expressed in various tissues of the worm are
targeted by RNAi. This indicates a very general role of Rrf-3
in opposing the RNAi pathway. It is thought that Rrf-3 com-
petes with the RdRPs involved in the RNAi pathway, Rrf-1
and Ego-1, for intermediates or components of the RNAi
pathway (Fig. 1). It also has been observed that repetitive
transgene silencing in C. elegans is enhanced in rrf-3 mutants
[14,16] suggesting that Rrf-3 is involved in antagonizing both
the classical RNAi pathway and the transgene silencing path-
way. rrf-3 mutant strains represent a useful tool for reverse
genetics. When rrf-3 mutant worms were used for a genome-
wide RNAi screen, more phenotypes associated with gene
knockdown were observed.

Genetic screens for mutants with enhanced RNAi sensitivity
(eri) were performed in Ruvkun lab and nineteen candidate
mutants were isolated [17]. The strongest eri mutant, eri-1,
has been cloned. eri-1 encodes a protein containing a SAP do-
main found in DNA binding proteins and a DEDDh-like
30 ﬁ 50 exonuclease domain found in RNases that degrade 30
overhangs in dsRNA [17]. Both Eri-1 and its likely human
orthologue, 30hExo, partially degrade siRNAs, but not single
stranded RNA in vitro (Fig. 1). It was shown that antisense
siRNAs accumulate to the higher level in eri-1 mutants. Eri-
1 is expressed preferentially in the neurons and somatic gonad,
which might explain why neuronal genes are less susceptible to
RNAi
in C. elegans. Phenotypes observed in eri-1 mutant
worms, such as temperature-dependent sterility and low fre-
quency X chromosome non-disjunction, are similar to those
of rrf-3, indicating a possibility that these genes act in the same
RNAi opposing pathway.

A new class of eri mutants corresponding to genes in previ-
ously identiﬁed chromatin repressive pathway, including Rb,
has been described recently [45]. This pathway functions inde-
pendently of rrf-3 and eri-1 and is likely to be directly involved
in the repression of the germline-speciﬁc genes in the somatic
tissues of C. elegans [45].

Activity of adenosine deaminases

that act on RNA
(ADARs) converts adenosines in the dsRNA into inosines,
thus mutating an A–U pair to an I–U wobble pair. dsRNAs
edited by ADARs have been shown to be progressively less
eﬃcient in RNAi as the level of deamination increases [46].
ADAR editing correlates with reduced siRNAs production
in Drosophila cell-free extracts indicating that deaminated
dsRNA is not a suitable substrate for Dicer [46]. In C. elegans,
there are two genes encoding ADARs, adr-1 and adr-2. Muta-
tions in these genes, either single or combined, did not aﬀect
the eﬃciency of RNAi induced by exogenous dsRNA. How-
ever, in C. elegans, somatic repetitive transgenic array silencing
was signiﬁcantly increased in adr-1; adr-2 double mutants [18].
Silencing of the transgenic arrays under these conditions was
dependent on the classical RNAi pathway gene rde-1 [18].
Moreover, dsRNAs produced from a transgenic array [18] or
from transposons [43] were found to be deaminated in wild
type animals. These ﬁndings indicate that ADARs successfully
compete with Dicer for dsRNA produced in the nucleus
(Fig. 1), but not for injected dsRNA. This can be explained
by diﬀerent sub-cellular localization of ADARs and Dicer;
ADARs are mostly localized to the nucleus and Dicer is likely
to be located in the cytoplasm. Since silencing of repetitive ar-
rays occurs very eﬃciently in the germline despite the presence
of ADARs, this tissue is likely to contain additional factors

ensuring robust response to dsRNA via RNAi related path-
ways (see Table 1).

It is possible that RNAi and ADAR pathways do not always
antagonize each other, but might synergize as well. A recent re-
port indicates that the RISC subunit Tudor-SN interacts with
hyper-edited dsRNA and promotes its cleavage in Xenopus oo-
cyte extracts [47]. This suggests that nuclease activities in-
volved in dsRNA response are co-localized in the same
complex, RISC.

6. Regulation of endogenous genes by RNAi related mechanisms

microRNAs (miRNAs), endogenous short RNAs with a
regulatory function, are related to siRNAs in that they are
produced by Dicer and they function with Argonaute family
of proteins [6] (see reviews by Tuschl and Wienholds and
Plasterk in this issue). miRNA precursors form a hairpin struc-
ture and are part of larger transcripts called pri-miRNAs. The
ﬁrst miRNAs, lin-4 and let-7, were identiﬁed genetically in
C. elegans as components of
the heterochronic pathway
responsible for timing of developmental events in the worm.
Studies of lin-4 and let-7 laid the foundation to understanding
how miRNAs negatively regulate their target mRNAs by
interacting with target sites in the 30UTRs [6]. Target sites
for miRNAs are not perfectly complementary and this interac-
tion is thought to lead to translational repression of the
targeted message, although a low level of mRNA degradation
has also been observed. At present, a large number of miRNAs
has been cloned from a variety of organisms, ranging from
nematodes and plants to mammals (see review by Tuschl in
this issue). Computational methods have predicted targets
for most mammalian miRNAs indicating that 20% of the
genes are likely to be regulated by miRNAs. This implies that
many biological pathways are likely to include miRNAs.
Although the full extent of miRNA regulation has not been
uncovered yet, the pace of validating new miRNA targets is
extremely rapid (see reviews by Wienholds and Plasterk and
Bentwich in this issue).

Short RNAs produced from dsRNAs corresponding to
endogenous repetitive elements play a role in silencing of these
elements in cis or related elements in trans. This type of regu-
lation most often results in heterochromatin formation and
transcriptional silencing of the repetitive elements (see review
by Moazed in this issue). This process is best characterized
in S. pombe where mutations in RNAi pathway genes lead to
defects in chromosome segregation. The hallmark of chroma-
tin associated with silencing is methylation of histone H3 at ly-
sine 9 (H3K9), while methylation of H3 at lysine 4 is associated
with active genes. Studies in S. pombe, Drosophila and
plants have connected RNAi related processes with H3K9
methylation.

Does RNAi

induced H3K9 methylation play a role in
endogenous gene regulation in the worms? In C. elegans, low
level of H3K9 methylation on all chromosomes is observed
during a pachytene stage of meiotic prophase [48]. Also, there
is a very prominent presence of this mark on the unpaired male
X chromosome [39]. Some RNAi pathway components, such
as RdRP Ego-1 [29], and the RNA helicase Rha-1 [42], are
important
including
meiosis. Downregulation of Dcr-1 by RNAi also shows defects
in meiosis [49]. Therefore, RNAi pathways might be involved

for normal germline development,

in chromatin regulation during meiosis and during silencing of
the unpaired X chromosome in males.

Kelly and colleagues [42] showed that the H3K9 modiﬁca-
tion level is reduced in rha-1 mutants. Interestingly, the mam-
malian RNA helicase A (RHA) was found recently in a
complex with vigilin [50], a protein implicated in heterochro-
matin formation in mammalian cells and Drosophila. A com-
plex consisting of vigilin, DNA-dependent protein kinase
subunits Ku70 and Ku80 and RHA associates speciﬁcally with
inosine containing dsRNA and is thought to mediate dsRNA
induced formation of heterochromatin [50]. Thus, RHA seems
to play a role in two pathways inducing chromatin formation
in response to dsRNA, RNAi and the ADAR pathways.

Both in Drosophila and C. elegans, Polycomb Group (PcG)
related genes have been implicated in RNAi-induced silencing
[38,51]. This raises the possibility of siRNAs directing H3K27
chromatin modiﬁcation, since the PcG protein possesses
H3K27 methyltransferase activity. Regulation of homeotic
genes by PcG proteins is conserved and PcG mutants are often
recognized by homeotic transformations due to de-repression
of Hox genes. Although RNAi and miRNA pathway mutants
do not show de-repression of Hox genes, it is possible that sev-
eral RNAi related processes might act redundantly in this type
of regulation.

Consistent with the possible role of RNAi-related processes
in endogenous gene regulation in C. elegans, a number of short
RNAs corresponding to coding genes and intragenic regions
have recently been cloned [44]. Presumably these endogenous
siRNAs are processed from dsRNA produced as a result of
antisense transcription. Recent studies detected a large number
of antisense transcripts in mammalian genomes. It is likely that
interplay between ADAR and RNAi activities in diﬀerent cells
and tissues determines the level of siRNA mediated regulation.
The challenge for studies of endogenous RNAi is in connect-
ing various developmental phenotypes of RNAi mutants with
possible targets represented by cloned siRNAs. The transient
nature of siRNAs inducing chromatin eﬀects might represent
an additional challenge. Nevertheless, C. elegans remains a
very powerful system for studying RNAi mechanisms and will
surely bring many new discoveries and insights.
