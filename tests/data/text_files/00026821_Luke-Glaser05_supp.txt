Figure S1. Analysis of Cortical Ruffling of
Wild-Type, cul-3(RNAi), mei-1(ct46gf), and
mel-26(ct61sb4lf) Embryos
Analysis of cortical ruffling of wild-type (n ⫽
5), cul-3(RNAi) (n ⫽ 5; dark red), mei-1(ct46gf)
(n ⫽ 5; light blue), and mel-26(ct61sb4lf) (n ⫽
4; blue) embryos. Membrane ingressions
(ruffles) in addition to the pseudocleavage
formation that persisted for at least 50 s were
counted until pronuclear meeting (time ⫽ 0),
and blotted against time (in seconds). Note
that mei-1(ct46gf) does not display ruffling.

Ectopic membrane ruffling-1 E1 for Neddd8
Cullin-3. Serves as scaffold in E3 ligases that target proteins for ubiquitin-dependent degradation.
Maternal effect lethal-26. Substrate-specific adaptor in CUL-3 complex. Degraded by CUL-3.
Meiosis-1 katanin-like AAATpase. Severs microtubules. Degraded by the CUL-3/MEL-26 complex

at the meiosis-to-mitosis transition.

Tubulin beta ␤-tubulin
Cytokinesis defect. Formin homology protein. Involved in polymerization of actin.
Zygote-defective, embryonic lethal XMAP215 ortholog (microtubule-associated protein required for

formation of long microtubules).

Polarity- and osmotic sensitivity-defective Coronin-like protein.
Nonmuscular myosin-2
Wild-type
Loss-of-function mutation
Gain-of-function mutation
Meprin and TRAF homology protein domain
Bric a` brac, tramtrack, broad complex protein domain
