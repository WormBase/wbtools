Suppl_Fig_1. Ex-1 caused ectopic expressions in distance dependent manner. 
A 286 bp intestine specific promoter, Ce-haf-4 yielded moderate GFP expression in intestine. Ex-L-
Ex-1-Ex-R joined at the 5’ end of Ce-haf-4 caused ectopic expression in the excretory cell (indicated 
by arrow). The Ex-L-Ex-1-Ex-R sequence did not cause ectopic RFP expression when fused at the 5’ 
end of a 1724 bp pharynx specific promoter Ce-pgp-14 and an 1193 bp intestine specific promoter 
Ce-pmp-1.  
 
Suppl_Fig_2. DCP-66 shows good alignment only within Zinc finger containing regions with its 
homologs from other organisms 
Protein sequences for DCP-66 is used to search non-redundant database using PSI-BLAST at NCBI. 
The resulting hits with highest score were used for multiple alignment. Sequences used in the 
alignment include C. elegans (gi|12705727), C. briggsae (gi|39582481), Drosophila (gi|23093698), 
Mus musculus (gi|23398610), Rattus norvegicus (gi|34877681) and Homo sapiens (gi|21218438). 
Alignment was performed using the MultAlin program (www.toulouse.inra.fr/multalin.html). Red and 
blue residues represent high and low identity, respectively. The two well-conserved regions were 
underlined in red and blue. The first region seems only conserved in vertebrates. The second region 
contains zinc finger domain. Symbols: !, I or V; $, L or M; %, F or Y; #, N, D, Q, E, B, or Z. 
 
Suppl_Fig_3.  Mutant phenotypes for dcp-66 deletion. 
Outcrossed VC924 strain was plated at 20 °C and small non-GFP adults were picked up for taking 
pictures as described in Experimental Procedures. Homozygous dcp-66 mutants are small and show 
defects in multiple tissues. A: shrunk intestine; B: desiccated germline and defective vulva; C:  
protruding vulva; D: defects in posterior intestine. 
 
Suppl_Fig_4. Ex-1 profile and its distribution among excretory cell-specific or non-specific promoters 
A: Ex-1 profile is significantly overrepresented in genes expressed exclusively in the excretory cell.  
50% (4 out of 8) of the excretory cell exclusive (I) and 12.2% (10 out of 82) of the excretory cell non-
exclusive gene promoters (II) contain Ex-1 profile while only 4% (9 out of 223) of the genes that are 
expressed in posterior neurons but not in excretory cell have the profile in their promoter regions (III). 
Vertical axis: percentage of genes whose promoter regions contain Ex-1 profile; horizontal axis: gene 
categories by expression in excretory. B:  Weblogo of Ex-1 profile by online program at 
Weblogo.Berkeley.edu using the eight positive hits from excretory cell exclusive promoters. 
 
 
Suppl_Fig_5.  DCP-66 binds Ex-1 but not Ex-2 or Ex-3 in vitro as determined by EMSA described in 
Experimental Procedures. Labeled probes for Lane 1, 2 and 3 are Ex-1, Ex-2 and Ex-3 respectively. 
Shifted band for Ex-1 is indicated by arrowhead.
