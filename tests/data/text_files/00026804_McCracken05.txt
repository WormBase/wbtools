In this study, we describe a rapid immunoaffinity purification
procedure for gel-free tandem mass spectrometry-based analysis of
endogenous protein complexes and apply it to the characterization
of complexes containing the SRm160 (serine/arginine repeat-re-
lated nuclear matrix protein of 160 kDa) splicing coactivator. In
addition to promoting splicing, SRm160 stimulates 3ⴕ-end process-
ing via its N-terminal PWI nucleic acid-binding domain and is
found in a post-splicing exon junction complex that has been impli-
cated in coupling splicing with mRNA turnover, export, and trans-
lation. Consistent with these known functional associations, we
found that the majority of proteins identified in SRm160-contain-
ing complexes are associated with pre-mRNA processing. Interest-
ingly, SRm160 is also associated with factors involved in chromatin
regulation and sister chromatid cohesion, specifically the cohesin
subunits SMC1␣, SMC3, RAD21, and SA2. Gradient fractionation
suggested that there are two predominant SRm160-containing
complexes, one enriched in splicing components and the other
enriched in cohesin subunits. Co-immunoprecipitation and co-lo-
calization experiments, as well as combinatorial RNA interference
in Caenorhabditis elegans, support the existence of conserved and
functional interactions between SRm160 and cohesin.

The development of high throughput procedures for gel-free tandem
mass spectrometry-based identification of factors in multisubunit com-
plexes has provided a wealth of information on the functional associa-
tions of proteins (1–3). Often, proteins targeted for purification are
expressed with affinity tags, allowing coupling to affinity resins with
antibodies or ligands specific for the tag moieties. Unlike the situation in
yeast, mammalian systems are not amenable to efficient genetic recom-
bination procedures allowing the expression of epitope-tagged proteins
under the control of endogenous promoters. Consequently, many affin-
ity purification procedures have been performed using tagged factors
overexpressed by transient transfection or from stably integrated con-
structs. Overexpression often has the major drawback of resulting in

nonspecific associations with the tagged factor, and developing tagged
cell lines is time-consuming and laborious.

An alternative to the purification of tagged, exogenously expressed
proteins is to target endogenous proteins with specific antibodies. This
affords the main advantage of allowing the recovery of proteins associ-
ated with endogenous levels of the targeted proteins, thereby avoiding
overexpression artifacts. In this study, we utilized this approach to
investigate the composition of complexes associated with SRm160, a
splicing coactivator that is also implicated in the coupling of different
steps in gene expression at the post-transcriptional level (4–8).

SRm160 was originally identified as a nuclear matrix antigen that is
highly concentrated in interphase nuclear “speckle” domains (inter-
chromatin granule clusters) enriched in splicing components (9, 10).
Interestingly, unlike other splicing components concentrated in speck-
les, SRm160 undergoes a dramatic redistribution during mitosis,
becoming concentrated at the spindle poles and at the spindle (4, 10).
Subsequent cloning of an SRm160 cDNA revealed that it contains an
arginine/serine repeat domain, a feature of many defined splicing fac-
tors (4). Biochemical experiments showed that SRm160 (i) associates
with splicing complexes, (ii) functions as a coactivator of constitutive
and exon enhancer-dependent splicing, and (iii) stimulates 3⬘-end
formation (4, 5, 7, 8, 11). SRm160 remains bound to processed
mRNA in an exon junction complex located ⬃20–24 nucleotides
upstream of exon-exon junctions (6, 12, 13). Although the precise
role of SRm160 in the exon junction complex is not known, other
factors in this complex have been implicated as adaptors that link to
mRNA export, turnover by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, and
translation (14).

To gain further insight into the cellular functions of SRm160, com-
plexes affinity-purified with different SRm160-specific antibodies were
analyzed for novel and conserved interactions. In addition to generating
an extensive data base of associated pre-mRNA processing compo-
nents, factors associated with transcription, chromatin regulation, and
sister chromatid cohesion were identified in the purified complexes.
Interestingly, a complete set of subunits associated with the mitotic
cohesin complex co-purified with SRm160, including SMC1␣ (struc-
tural maintenance of chromosome 1␣), SMC3, human (h)2 RAD21
(double-strand break repair protein rad21 homolog), and SA2 (stromal
antigen 2).

Cohesin is essential for sister chromatid cohesion, ensuring correct

chromosome segregation (15, 16). In higher eukaryotes, it is composed
of four subunits, a subset of which corresponds to mitosis- and meiosis-
specific isotypes. The subunits hRAD21 and SA1/2 function in mitosis,
whereas SMC1␤, REC8, and STAG3 function during meiosis, and both
SMC1␣and SMC3 function in mitosis and meiosis (reviewed in Refs. 17
and 18). Subunits of the mitotic cohesin complex are also important for
DNA repair and the ATM-dependent S phase checkpoint (reviewed in
Ref. 18).

The interaction between SRm160 and cohesin subunits identified in
this study is conserved in Xenopus laevis. We also found that simulta-
neous knockdown by RNA interference (RNAi) of Caenorhabditis
elegans (Ce) SRm160 and coh-1 (an ortholog of rad21) results in an early
embryonic lethal phenotype, whereas single RNAi of coh-1 results in an
uncoordinated phenotype, and single RNAi of SRm160 results in no
apparent phenotype. This suggests that SRm160 and coh-1 interact
genetically in the same pathway. Moreover, consistent with a possible
cellular function of SRm160 in sister chromatid cohesion or a cohesin-
related activity, SRm160 localizes to the cohesin-containing core of syn-
aptonemal complexes in spermatocytes, at the pachytene stage of mei-
otic prophase I. Together, our results provide evidence for a conserved
functional association between SRm160 and cohesins.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

Immunopurification of Endogenous Complexes—Prior to immuno-
precipitation, nuclear extract was preincubated for 15 min at 30 °C
under splicing conditions (2 mM MgCl2, 1.5 mM ATP, and 5 mM phos-
phocreatine) with the addition of an RNase mixture (16 ng/␮l; Roche
Applied Science) and DNase I (0.3 units/␮l) and in the presence of
phosphatase inhibitors (1 mM potassium fluoride, 0.1 mM sodium pyro-
phosphate, and 1 mM sodium ␤-glycerophosphate). A similar treatment
was used prior to loading the sample onto a gel filtration column. Pro-
tein A-Sepharose (30 ␮l of packed beads) was loaded with rabbit anti-
mouse IgG and IgM antibody (72 ␮g), monoclonal antibody (mAb)
8WG16 (50 ␮g), antigen affinity-purified rabbit anti-SRm160 poly-
clonal antibody (pAb) (50 ␮g), or rabbit anti-SRm300 serum (25 ␮l),
followed by cross-linking with 20 mM dimethylpimelimidate (19) and
loading of the control IgM protein (Sigma) or mAb B1C8 (1.5 ml of
culture supernatant, ⬃150 ␮g) onto rabbit anti-mouse antibody-coated
beads. Control immunoprecipitations were performed with rabbit anti-
mouse antibody-coated beads with or without the control IgM protein.
HeLa nuclear extract (1.5 mg) (20) or cytostatic factor-arrested egg
extract from X. laevis (1.5 mg) (21) was preincubated with ATP, Mg2⫹,
and phosphocreatine as well as DNase and RNase (7) at 30 °C for 15 min.
The extract was incubated with the beads for 3 h at 4 °C with gentle
rotation in 60 mM NaCl, 13 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.4 mM MgCl2, 14%
glycerol, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.7 mM ␤-glycerophosphate, 0.7 mM
NaF, and 0.07 mM sodium pyrophosphate in a final volume of 750 ␮l.
The beads were washed three times (1.5 ml) with 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM
Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mM dithio-
threitol and eluted with 2 M NaCl, 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), and 1 mM
EDTA (200 ␮l), followed by a brief wash with 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5)
and 1 mM EDTA (200 ␮l). These pooled eluates were back-bound with
protein A-Sepharose and with rabbit anti-mouse IgG/IgM-coated pro-
tein A-Sepharose for 30 min at 4 °C with rotation. After removal of the
beads, the samples were bound to 10 ␮l of phenyl-Sepharose for 1 h at
4 °C and then collected by centrifugation. The beads were eluted with 50
␮l of 8 M urea and 10 mM Tris (pH 8.8), followed by a wash with 50 ␮l of
10 mM Tris (pH 8.8). The pooled eluates were then digested with trypsin
prior to mass spectrometry, which was performed as described (22). If
the immunoprecipitates were to be analyzed by Western blotting, the

phenyl-Sepharose step was omitted, and the samples were precipitated
with 20% trichloroacetic acid and 1.5 mg/ml sodium deoxycholate,
washed with 10% trichloroacetic acid and with acetone, resuspended in
SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE.

Antisera—Analysis of SRm160-containing fractions was performed
using mAb B1C8 (mouse) (10), rabbit anti-SRm160 pAb (4), and goat
anti-SRm160 K15 pAb (a commercial affinity-purified peptide-specific
antibody raised against the SRm160 C terminus; Santa Cruz Biotech-
nology, Inc.). Rabbit anti-SRm300, anti-SMC1␣, and anti-SMC3 pAbs
have been described previously (4, 23). Rabbit anti-hRAD21 and anti-
transcription factor IIF pAbs, mAb 104, and mAb Y12 were generous
gifts from Jan Michael Peters, Jack Greenblatt, Mark Roth, and Joan
Steitz, respectively.

Synchronization of Cells—Cells were synchronized by double thymi-
dine block using two cycles of block with 2 mM thymidine for 16 h,
followed by release. G1/S phase cells were harvested directly from the
blocked cells; mitotic cells were released from the block and incubated
in fresh medium until entry into mitosis.

Immunoblotting—Proteins were transferred from SDS-polyacryl-
amide gels by wet electrotransfer overnight, and immunoblot analysis
was performed as described previously (7).

Gel Filtration—HeLa nuclear extract (10 mg) was incubated with
ATP, Mg2⫹, and phosphocreatine as well as RNase and DNase and
loaded onto a 1.5 ⫻ 28-cm Sephacryl S400 column equilibrated with
20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithio-
threitol, 10% glycerol, 1 mM ␤-glycerophosphate, 1 mM KF, and 0.1
mM sodium pyrophosphate. Fractions were collected and analyzed
by immunoblotting.

RNAi in C. elegans—RNAi in C. elegans was performed as described

previously (24).

Immunofluorescence—Mouse spermatocytes for immunoblot analy-
sis were prepared as described (25). Nuclear spreads for immunofluo-
rescence studies were performed as described (26).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Proteomic Analysis of SRm160-containing Complexes—A rapid
immunoaffinity purification procedure was developed for the gel-free
mass spectrometric analysis of SRm160-containing complexes in HeLa
nuclear extract. This procedure, which is potentially applicable to any
endogenous protein complex for which a specific and immunoprecipi-
tation-competent antibody exists, is outlined in Fig. 1A and summarized
in the legend. A more detailed description is also given under “Experi-
mental Procedures.”

Two different antibodies that are highly specific for SRm160 were
employed in multiple independent immunoaffinity purifications. One
of these antibodies, mAb B1C8 (10), is a murine monoclonal antibody
that was originally used to purify SRm160 (4). The other antibody (rab-
bit anti-SRm160 pAb) is an antigen affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal
antibody raised against the conserved N-terminal domain of SRm160
expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein. The specificity
of these antibodies for SRm160 has been demonstrated in several ways.
In immunoblots of total nuclear extract, both antibodies selectively rec-
ognize an ⬃160-kDa antigen that has been identified as SRm160 by
fractionation and peptide microsequencing (4, 27). In addition, both
antisera specifically recognized baculovirus-expressed recombinant
SRm160,3 and both have very similar properties in different bioassays.
For example, both antibodies preferentially immunoprecipitate exon-

FIGURE 1. Co-immunoprecipitation of SRm160
and subunits of the cohesin complex. A: the pro-
cedure for immunopurification of SRm160-con-
taining complexes is outlined. HeLa nuclear
extract was first pretreated extensively with RNase
and DNase to remove any endogenous nucleic
acids (7). The pretreated extract was incubated
with protein A-Sepharose beads covalently cou-
pled to anti-SRm160 antibody. After wash steps,
bound proteins were eluted in high salt. The high
salt eluate was then back-cleared to remove
immunoglobulin chains released from the protein
A beads. The remaining proteins were concen-
trated by hydrophobic binding to phenyl-Sepha-
rose, eluted in 8 M urea, and subjected to trypsin
digestion in solution, and the peptide mixtures
were analyzed by capillary-scale shotgun liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (1).

specifically stain speckles in interphase nuclei and the spindle apparatus
at mitosis (4). In addition, depletion of SRm160 from HeLa nuclear
extract using rabbit anti-SRm160 pAb prevents pre-mRNA splicing,
and activity can be restored to the depleted extract by addition of puri-
fied recombinant protein (28).

Also analyzed by mass spectrometry using our rapid immunopurifi-
cation procedure were complexes affinity-purified with a rabbit poly-
clonal antibody specific for SRm300 (serine/arginine repeat-related
nuclear matrix protein of 300 kDa) (rabbit anti-SRm300 pAb) (28), and
complexes were immunopurified with a murine monoclonal antibody
specific for the hypophosphorylated form of the largest subunit of RNA
polymerase II (pol II) (mAb 8WG16) (29). Rabbit anti-SRm300 pAb was
raised against a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing a
conserved N-terminal domain of SRm300 and has been shown to spe-

cifically recognize SRm300 in HeLa nuclear extract, to immunolabel
speckles, and to immunoprecipitate exon-containing splicing com-
plexes (28). Based on previous results demonstrating that the majority
of SRm300 in HeLa nuclear extracts is tightly associated with SRm160,
whereas a subpopulation of SRm160 exists that is not bound to SRm300
(4, 27, 28), we expected to detect a subset of SRm160-associated pro-
teins in the SRm300-containing complexes. In contrast, previous co-
immunoprecipitation analyses and fractionation studies did not reveal
any evidence for an association between SRm160-containing and pol
II-containing complexes (30, 31); and therefore, we did not expect to
observe a significant number of proteins that are shared between these
complexes.

Consistent with our previous results (4, 27, 28), 36% of the proteins
detected with high confidence (see below) in complexes immunopuri-
fied with rabbit anti-SRm300 pAb overlapped with proteins in the

immunopurified SRm160-containing complexes (TABLE ONE). In
contrast, the profile of proteins detected in the immunoaffinity purifi-
cation using mAb 8WG16 was quite distinct from the profiles observed
for the SRm160/300 purifications (supplemental Table 1). Finally, no
proteins other than the trypsinogen precursor were detected by mass

spectrometry in samples recovered from beads alone or from beads
coupled to a control antibody (rabbit anti-Ig; data not shown). These
results indicate that our immunoaffinity purification procedure results
in the efficient and specific recovery of proteins associated with immu-
noaffinity-purified complexes.

Supplemental Table 1 includes a complete list of proteins identified
by mass spectrometry in multiple independent purifications with each
antibody, along with information on the number of peptide spectra
detected for each protein. The large number of peptides identified in
these analyses reflects the sensitivity of the gel-free tandem mass spec-
trometric method. Proteins considered to associate with SRm160 with
relatively high specificity and affinity are shown in TABLE ONE; these
were detected by three or more independent peptide spectra in one or
more purifications with either of the two anti-SRm160 antibodies and
were not detected by mass spectrometry in pol II-containing complexes
co-immunoprecipitated with mAb 8WG16. Proteins detected in the
complexes affinity-purified with rabbit anti-SRm300 pAb are also listed
in TABLE ONE if they (i) were detected by one or more spectra that
overlapped with the proteins listed in TABLE ONE for the SRm160
purifications or (ii) were detected by three or more spectra irrespective
of their detection in the SRm160 purifications. Although these criteria
for specificity probably enrich for factors that form bona fide interac-
tions with SRm160/300, they potentially also exclude specific but less
strong interactions or factors that form specific and dual interactions
with SRm160/300- and pol II-containing complexes.

Pre-mRNA Processing Factors Associated with SRm160-containing
Complexes—Consistent with the known functional activities of SRm160
(see the Introduction), the majority of the proteins that interacted with
SRm160/300-containing complexes by the above criteria are function-
ally linked to pre-mRNA processing. These included many spliceosomal
proteins such as SF3b and U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP)-
associated proteins as well as proteins that remained associated with
spliced mRNA in the exon junction complex (SRm160, Y14, and eukary-
otic initiation factor 4AIII) (TABLE ONE and supplemental Table 1).
Moreover, in agreement with recent evidence from our laboratory indi-
cating that SRm160 participates in 3⬘-end processing (7, 8), we also
detected four 3⬘-end cleavage factors in the immunopurified complexes,
although with fewer peptide spectra per protein (supplemental Table 1).
Of particular interest among the spliceosomal proteins detected are
the multiple interactions with subunits of the U2 snRNP-associated
SF3b complex, including SAP145, SAP130, and SAP49 (TABLE ONE
and supplemental Table 1). These factors are known to form a
sequence-independent interaction upstream of the pre-mRNA branch
region (the “anchor site”) and to participate in formation of a pre-spli-
ceosomal complex containing U1 and U2 snRNPs (32, 33). Taken
together with our previous evidence that (i) SRm160 associates specifi-
cally with a subpopulation of U2 snRNPs in the absence of pre-mRNA
(4), (ii) U2 snRNP promotes the stable association of SRm160 with
pre-mRNA (4), and (iii) SRm160 promotes enhancer-dependent splic-
ing via interactions that appear to be independent of the binding of
U2AF to the polypyrimidine tract (19), the interactions detected with
SF3b subunits suggest that SRm160 could associate with pre-mRNA via
one or more interactions involving these proteins. This finding there-
fore provides new insight into the possible network of protein-protein
interactions by which SRm160 functions as a splicing coactivator.

Transcription and Chromatin Regulatory Factors Associated with
SRm160-containing Complexes—In addition to pre-mRNA processing
components, many of the factors found to associate with SRm160/300-
containing complexes are involved in pol II transcription and chromatin
regulation. Moreover, some of these factors, including the far upstream
element-binding protein FBP and its associated repressor protein
RoBP1, have already been associated functionally with splicing as well as
transcription (34, 35). The SR-related protein CAPER, which has
recently been implicated in the regulation of alternative splicing via
interactions with nuclear hormone receptor transcriptional activators

SRm160 Interacts with Cohesin

(36), was also detected in SRm160/300-containing complexes, as were
the nuclear hormone receptor (co)activator protein CIA (37) and the
transcriptional regulator CCR4-NOT (38) (TABLE ONE). These results
raise the possibility that SRm160/300 may function in the coupling of
transcription and splicing via one or more interactions involving pro-
moter-bound (co)activators and that this activity could be largely inde-
pendent of direct interactions with pol II. In addition, several subunits of
the NuRD chromatin remodeling complex (39–42), including SWI/
SNF-170, SWI/SNF-155, Mi-2␤, MCDB3, and Mta2, co-immunopre-
cipitated with SRm160/300, although they were detected with fewer
than three peptide spectra per protein (supplemental Table 1).

SRm160 Associates with Subunits of Cohesin—The immunoaffinity-
purified SRm160-containing complexes also include four subunits of
the human cohesin complex: SMC1␣/SMC1L1, SMC3, hRAD21, and
SA2 (TABLE ONE and supplemental Table 1). These four subunits of
cohesin, which function in both sister chromatid cohesion and DNA
recombination and repair activities, are known to form a complex in the
absence of chromatin. However, proteins that associate with SMC1 and
SMC3 in a DNA recombination/repair complex (RC1), including DNA
ligase III, DNA polymerase ⑀, and DNA endonuclease (43–45), the SA1
subunit of cohesin (46, 47), or subunits of the DNA damage-induced
BRCA1/SMC1/SMC3-containing complex (48, 49), were not identified
by mass spectrometry in the immunoaffinity-purified SRm160-contain-
ing complexes. This suggests that SRm160 could form a specific associ-
ation with the cohesin complex containing SMC1␣, SMC3, hRAD21,
and SA2.

We confirmed the co-immunoprecipitation of SMC1␣, SMC3, and
hRAD21 with SRm160 by immunoblot analysis with specific antisera
(Fig. 1B; see “Experimental Procedures”). Approximately 10–15% of
SMC1␣, SMC3, and hRAD21 in the extract immunoprecipitated with
mAb B1C8 (Fig. 1B, lane 3). The interaction of the cohesin subunits with
SRm160 appears to be quite specific based on the various controls
described above as well the observation that abundant proteins in the
nuclear extract (e.g. the U1–70K protein) (Fig. 1B) were not detected in
the mAb B1C8 immunoprecipitates by immunoblotting and were not
detected by immunoblotting of the immunoprecipitates collected with
rabbit anti-SRm300 pAb or mAb 8WG16 (Fig. 1B), whereas these latter
antibodies did immunoprecipitate the expected proteins (e.g. mAb
8WG16 immunoprecipitated transcription factor TFIIF p74) (Fig. 1B,
lanes 4 and 5, and TABLE ONE and supplemental Table 1). The absence
of detectable co-immunoprecipitation of the cohesin subunits with rab-
bit anti-SRm300 pAb suggests that these proteins were bound to the
subpopulation of SRm160 in the nuclear extract that was not associated
with SRm300. Immunoprecipitates collected with rabbit anti-SRm160
pAb, which binds to a separate region in SRm160, were immunoblotted
with the anti-SMC1␣antibody. Similar to the results with mAb B1C8, a
comparable level of SMC1␣in the extract was co-immunoprecipitated
with rabbit anti-SRm160 pAb (Fig. 1C, compare lane 4 with lanes 5–8),
thus providing strong evidence that the co-immunoprecipitation of
cohesin subunits with anti-SRm160 antibodies is due to an association
between cohesin and SRm160 and not a cross-reaction between mAb
B1C8 and one or more of the cohesin subunits. Finally, the association
between SRm160 and cohesin subunits is unlikely a consequence of
bridging interactions mediated by nucleic acid because the HeLa
nuclear extract used for immunopurifications was pretreated exten-
sively with both RNase and DNase using a protocol that efficiently
degrades the most stable nucleic acids (e.g. U5 small nuclear RNA) (7)
(data not shown).

Because cohesin is essential for sister chromatid cohesion and chro-
mosome segregation, we considered that the association with SRm160

might be dependent on the stage of the cell cycle. We prepared extracts
from HeLa cells synchronized in S or M phase by double thymidine
block and release and analyzed the interaction of SRm160 with SMC1
and hRAD21 at different stages of the cell cycle (Fig. 1D). The stage of
the cell cycle was confirmed by immunoblot analysis of the extracts with
an antibody directed against phosphorylated Tyr15 in Cdc2, which is
dephosphorylated upon entry into M phase (Fig. 1D, lower panel, lanes
2 and 3). Consistent with an earlier report (44), the level of SMC1 did not
change throughout the cell cycle (Fig. 1D, lower panel, lanes 4 and 5).
The relative levels of co-immunoprecipitation of SMC1␣and hRAD21
with SRm160 were similar in G1/S phase, M phase, and asynchronous
extracts, with ⬃15% of the input material being recovered in each case
(Fig. 1D, upper panel, compare lanes 1–3 with lanes 4–9).

Characterization of SRm160-Cohesin Interactions—Cohesins have
been highly purified by immunopurification and chromatographic sep-
aration, and their associations with other factors have been character-
ized (46, 50–55); SRm160 was not identified as an interacting compo-
nent in these previous studies. One possible reason for this is that the
association of SRm160 with cohesin subunits is salt-sensitive. This is
supported by the observation that cohesin subunits co-immunoprecipi-

tated with SRm160 at physiological salt concentrations (Fig. 2A, lanes
3–8), but that these associations were markedly reduced at salt concen-
trations above 200 mM (lanes 9–12). Based on this observation, chro-
matographic purifications of cohesin involving high salt elution or
ammonium sulfate precipitation, as used in previous studies (51, 53),
would not be expected to contain SRm160.

To investigate whether the cohesin subunits exist in association with
one or more distinct SRm160-containing complexes, we fractionated
HeLa nuclear extract at 100 mM salt by gel filtration after extensive
treatment with RNase and DNase and analyzed the fractions by immu-
noblotting with the different antisera to SRm160 as well as with antisera
to several of the SRm160-associated factors (Fig. 2B). Interestingly,
SRm160 was detected primarily in two different elution peaks, one cen-
tering on fraction 22 and the other centering on fraction 28. A form of
SRm160 with slightly slower electrophoretic mobility, peaking in frac-
tion 28, was detected more readily by mAb B1C8 and the murine
anti-SR protein mAb 104, which was previously shown to also detect
SRm160 (4). This can be explained by the observation that both mAb
B1C8 and mAb 104 recognize epitopes that are phosphatase-sensitive
(54).3 Both rabbit anti-SRm160 pAb (described above) and a peptide-

specific goat anti-SRm160 antibody (see “Experimental Procedures”)
detected a protein of identical mobility in this region of the gradient as
well as the more prominent, faster migrating form concentrated in frac-
tion 22 (Fig. 2B) (data not shown). The faster migrating form most likely
corresponds to SRm160 with a reduced phosphorylation status because
previous experiments have also demonstrated that phosphatase treat-
ment of nuclear extract or purified endogenous SRm160 significantly
reduces the mobility of the protein as detected with rabbit anti-SRm160
pAb (28).3

Interestingly, the SMC1␣, SMC3, and hRAD21 cohesin subunits
were predominantly concentrated in fractions 28–30, whereas SR pro-
tein splicing factors were predominantly concentrated in fraction 22
(Fig. 2B). Although the mAb B1C8-detected form of SRm160 did not
co-fractionate precisely with the cohesin subunits, this is consistent
with its having a less stable association with these factors compared with
their association with each other (Fig. 2A) and with the fact that only
10–15% of the total cohesin in nuclear extract associated with SRm160
during co-immunoprecipitation. This conclusion was further sup-
ported by the observation that SRm160 and cohesin displayed more
extensively separated elution profiles when gel filtration chromatogra-
phy of HeLa nuclear extract was repeated at a higher salt concentration
(500 mM). Together, the results therefore suggest that a more highly
phosphorylated form of SRm160 (detected preferentially by mAb B1C8
and mAb 104) preferentially co-fractionates with cohesin subunits,
whereas a less phosphorylated form (more strongly detected with the
anti-SRm160 pAbs) predominantly coelutes with SR protein splicing
factors and not with cohesin subunits (data not shown). Thus, it is
possible that differential phosphorylation modulates interactions
between SRm160 and different complexes and, consequently, its poten-
tial to function in different cellular processes.

Interactions between SRm160 and Cohesin Subunits Are Evolutionar-
ily Conserved—If the association between SRm160 and cohesin sub-
units is functionally important, we would expect to detect it in other
species as well. To test this, we assayed whether mAb B1C8 co-immu-
noprecipitates SMC1␣in X. laevis egg extract. SRm160 is highly con-
served in metazoans, especially within the N-terminal region of the
protein that includes the PWI motif (8). The Xenopus tropicalis open
reading frame (GenBankTM accession number BC074646) shares 85%
similarity and 78% identity (data not shown). mAb B1C8 was shown
previously to immunoprecipitate exon junction complexes containing
SRm160 that form on spliced mRNA in Xenopus egg extracts (6, 55).
Detection of a 220-kDa antigen in these studies is consistent with
SRm160 having a longer predicted open reading frame in Xenopus than
in human (954 versus 820 amino acids). Moreover, we detected a prom-
inent 220-kDa antigen in X. laevis egg extract with both mAb B1C8 and
rabbit anti-SRm160 pAb (Fig. 3A, lanes 2, 3, 5, and 6) (data not shown).
Rabbit anti-SRm160 pAb also recognized bands of ⬃160 and ⬃140 kDa
in Xenopus extract, which presumably correspond to different phos-
phoisoforms of SRm160. The detection of the 220-kDa antigen by rabbit
anti-SRm160 pAb in immunoprecipitates collected from Xenopus egg
extract with mAb B1C8 confirmed that these antibodies bound to the
same 220-kDa antigen (Fig. 3A, lanes 5 and 6). Together, these results
provide strong evidence that our antisera to hSRm160 specifically detect
the Xenopus ortholog of SRm160. Like SRm160, SMC1␣is highly con-
served in Xenopus (GenBankTM accession number O93308), sharing
85% identity over 1233 amino acids, and the anti-hSMC1 antibody
detected an antigen in Xenopus egg extract of identical mobility to the
human protein (Fig. 3B, compare lanes 1 and 3), which has been con-
firmed as Xenopus SMC1 (55). Similar to the results in HeLa nuclear
extract, mAb B1C8 co-immunoprecipitated 10–20% of total SMC1 in

This indicates that the interaction between SRm160 and SMC1 is con-
served between distantly related vertebrate species.

A Genetic Interaction between SRm160 and Cohesin in C. ele-
gans—RNAi was used next to investigate a possible functional relation-
ship between SRm160 and the cohesin complex in the context of animal
development. C. elegans provides a convenient model organism to
address this question because the CeSRm160 ortholog (rsr-1) is highly
conserved, sharing 39% identity and 48% similarity with mammalian
SRm160 (56). Furthermore, because CeSRm160 is a nonessential pro-
tein (24), it is possible to investigate which other nonessential factors
interact with it genetically using combinatorial RNAi. Cohesin subunits
are represented by several orthologs in C. elegans that share consider-
able sequence identity, and previous experiments using RNAi have
established that these proteins function in the same pathways as they do
in mammals (supplemental Table 2).

Previous combinatorial RNAi experiments have also established that
simultaneous RNAi of CeSRm160 and different CeSR proteins or
3⬘-end cleavage factors results in specific developmental defects,
whereas single RNAi of these factors in most cases does not result in
apparent phenotypes (11, 24, 56). The specificity of the combinatorial
RNAi phenotypes observed in these previous studies most likely reflects
the specificity of conserved interactions and functional associations
observed between human SRm160, SR, and cleavage proteins. Thus,

combinatorial RNAi of CeSRm160 and conserved partner proteins,
identified by biochemical assays in the mammalian system, can provide
useful information on the potential role of conserved interactions
involving SRm160 in the context of whole animal development.

RNAi of the orthologs of most C. elegans cohesin subunits results in
early embryonic lethal phenotypes (57–59); these genes therefore can-
not be tested for genetic interactions with SRm160. However, RNAi of
coh-1 (the hRAD21 homolog) has been reported to produce a weak
uncoordinated phenotype (supplemental Table 2). We therefore deter-
mined whether simultaneous RNAi of CeSRm160 and coh-1 results in
an exacerbated phenotype. Interestingly, an embryonic lethal pheno-
type (18% of animals) and a strong uncoordinated phenotype were
observed (TABLE TWO). Simultaneous RNAi of coh-1 and either of the
splicing factors CeSRp75 and CeRNPS1, which are known to associate
with a subpopulation of SRm160 in human extracts (11, 56), did not
result in an altered phenotype because the majority of the animals were
weak uncoordinated (TABLE TWO). These results suggest that
SRm160 is functionally linked to the cohesin complex and that an inter-
action between these factors may be important for animal development.
SRm160 Is Present in Meiotic Synaptonemal Complexes—The con-
served interaction between SMC1␣, SMC3, and hRAD21 with a sub-
population of SRm160 in nuclear extract and the observation of a com-
binatorial RNAi phenotype between SRm160 and coh-1 in C. elegans
strongly suggest that SRm160 exists in one or more functional com-
plexes with cohesins in vivo. To further investigate this, we determined
whether SRm160 localizes at cohesin-containing meiotic synaptonemal
complexes (SCs) that form between paired homologous chromosomes
because these can be readily visualized by microscopy in mouse sper-
matocytes at the pachytene stage of meiotic prophase I. Using this sys-
tem, it has been shown that meiosis-specific cohesin subunits (which
include the SRm160-interacting subunit SMC3) are localized to fiber-
like structures along the SCs, which correspond to cohesin cores co-
localizing with axial elements (60). Moreover, it has been shown that
SMC1␤is required for normal progression of prophase I in mouse sper-
matocytes (60). The cohesin cores co-localize precisely with SCP3/
COR1 (61), a core SC component located primarily in the axial ele-
ments; and antibodies
in
immunolocalization studies, were therefore used as a marker for the
cohesin cores.

factor, which perform well

Immunoblot analysis of total (asynchronous) spermatocytes and
spermatocytes synchronized at the diplotene and pachytene stages with
both rabbit anti-SRm160 pAb and mAb B1C8 resulted in the detection
of an ⬃180-kDa antigen (Fig. 4A, lanes 2–5) (data not shown). Although
a minor 180-kDa form of SRm160 has been detected by mAb B1C8 in
human cell extracts (e.g. Fig. 2B) (9), the more prominent detection of an
antigen of this size in mouse extracts could reflect differences in the
phosphorylation status of SRm160 and/or the increased size of the
mouse protein compared with the human protein (897 versus 820 amino
acids) as predicted from a full-length mouse cDNA sequence (Gen-
BankTM accession number NM_016799). Immunostaining of the

mouse spermatocytes with mAb B1C8 (Fig. 4B, upper panels) and anti-
gen affinity-purified rabbit anti-SRm160 pAb (lower panels) revealed
that both antibodies strongly labeled SCs that formed between paired
autosomes, as revealed by co-immunostaining with murine monoclonal
and rabbit polyclonal antisera specific for SCP3/COR1 (Fig. 4B, upper
and lower panels, respectively). (Note that the immunostainings with
rabbit anti-SRm160 and anti-SCP3/COR1 pAbs were slightly displaced
in the overlays to more readily afford direct comparison of the individ-
ual staining patterns.) An antiserum specific for the centromeres was
also included in the immunostainings, and these sites are indicated. The
control rabbit anti-glutathione S-transferase pAb did not label these or
any other structures in the spreads (data not shown). The localization of
SRm160 to SCs associated with unpaired X and Y cores (Fig. 4B) sug-
gests that SRm160 is closely associated with the cohesin core structures
that form part of the SC axial elements. The localization of SRm160 to

SCs is consistent with its having a possible functional association with
cohesin during homologous chromosome pairing and recombination
during meiosis.

Conclusion—The characterization by tandem mass spectrometry of
immunopurified SRm160/300-containing complexes in this study
resulted in the discovery of new factors that interact with these proteins.
Several of these interactions suggest previously unanticipated functions
for SRm160. The detection of associations with many new factors
involved in pre-mRNA processing, as well as the identification of asso-
ciated factors that function in chromatin remodeling, suggests that
SRm160, possibly in association with SRm300, could function in the
coupling of pre-mRNA processing with transcription via interactions
that impact on chromatin.

Our observation that core subunits of a cohesin complex form con-
served associations with a subpopulation of SRm160 indicates that these
factors participate in one or more common cellular functions. Interest-
ingly, previous mass spectrometric analyses of purified splicing com-
plexes revealed SMC1 and SMC2 in pre-spliceosomes (62, 63), although
the functional significance of these interactions was not investigated.
Moreover, extensive mutagenesis screens for splicing factors in budding
yeast have not yielded any pre-mRNA processing gene mutants that
correspond to cohesin subunit genes, which nevertheless are highly
conserved in this organism (64). Our identification of interactions
between SRm160 and SMC1␣, SMC3, hRAD21, and SA2 and the local-
ization of SRm160 to core regions of SCs argue that it is more likely that
SRm160 functions with cohesin in the context of one or more activities
associated with chromatin structure and/or sister chromatid cohesion.
The presence of a highly conserved PWI motif in SRm160, which can
bind both single- and double-stranded DNA and RNA (8), further sug-
gests a possible separate role for SRm160 in DNA metabolism, in addi-
tion to its functions in pre-mRNA processing. Finally, the developmen-
tal defect observed in C. elegans upon simultaneous RNAi of coh-1 and
CeSRm160, but not upon simultaneous RNAi of coh-1 and other C. el-
egans splicing factor orthologs (CeSRp75 and CeRNPS1), also supports
a separate functional role for SRm160 in association with cohesins.
