Summary

Background: The initiation of a cleavage furrow is
essential to separate cells during cytokinesis, but little
is known about the mechanisms controlling this actin-
driven process. Previous studies in C. elegans embryos
revealed that inactivation of the CUL-3-based E3 ligase
activator rfl-1 results in an aberrant microtubule net-
work, ectopic furrowing during pronuclear migration,
and defects during cytokinesis.
Results: Here, we show that MEL-26, a substrate-spe-
cific adaptor of the CUL-3-based E3 ligase, is required
for efficient cell separation and cleavage furrow ingres-
sion during the C. elegans early mitotic divisions. Loss
of MEL-26 function leads to delayed onset and slow
ingression of cytokinesis furrows that frequently regress.
Conversely, increased levels of MEL-26 in cul-3(RNAi)
and rfl-1 mutant embryos cause a hypercontractile cor-
tex, with several simultaneously ingressing furrows
during pronuclear migration. MEL-26 accumulates at
cleavage furrows and binds the actin-interacting pro-
tein POD-1. Importantly, POD-1 is not a substrate of the
MEL-26/CUL-3 ligase but is required to localize MEL-
26 to the cortex.
Conclusions: Our results suggest that MEL-26 not only
acts as a substrate-specific adaptor within the MEL-
26/CUL-3 complex, but also promotes cytokinesis by a
CUL-3- and microtubule-independent mechanism.

Introduction

Cytokinesis is the final step of mitosis, in which the rep-
licated and segregated genome is sequestered into two
separate cells through the contraction of an actomyo-
sin-based ring. Local activation of the small GTPase
RhoA is crucial for cleavage furrow ingression [1–3],
and constriction of the cleavage furrow is mediated by
the nonmuscle myosin that exerts its motor activity on

F-actin. F-actin in turn is nucleated by formins, which
are effectors of RhoA (reviewed by [4]).

In addition to the actin cytoskeleton, specific effects
of microtubules on cortical activity have also been doc-
umented (reviewed by [4]). While astral microtubules
stimulate the cortex to form a cleavage furrow in sand
dollar eggs [5], a Drosophila melanogaster mutant lack-
ing astral microtubules is still proficient to induce cyto-
kinesis [6], suggesting that the central spindle rather
than the astral microtubules may account for furrow in-
gression in this organism. In contrast, the minima of
microtubule density were shown to be important for de-
termining the plane of division in the nematode Caeno-
rhabditis elegans [7]. However, little is known about the
upstream components that position the cleavage fur-
row and trigger its ingression.

We are interested in the role of ubiquitin-dependent
degradation processes during the early cell division of
C. elegans embryos. Recently, we found that rfl-1 (ec-
topic membrane ruffling-1) mutant embryos not only
exhibit severe defects in microtubule-dependent pro-
cesses, but also show excessive ectopic furrowing of
the cortex during pronuclear migration [8]. RFL-1 func-
tions as an E1 enzyme, which is needed to activate the
CUL-3-based E3 ubiquitin ligase by covalent attach-
ment of the ubiquitin-like protein Nedd8 to the cullin
CUL-3. The CUL-3 complex, in turn, triggers the degra-
dation of the katanin-like protein MEI-1 (meiosis-1) [8,
9], a member of the AAA ATPase family that is believed
to sever microtubules during meiosis to facilitate the
extrusion of polar bodies [10, 11]. MEI-1 has to be de-
graded at the meiosis-to-mitosis transition to allow the
assembly of long microtubules to anchor the mitotic
spindle to the cortex and properly segregate the chro-
mosomes [12]. The BTB (bric à brac, tramtrack, broad
complex)-containing protein MEL-26 (maternal effect
lethal-26 [13]) functions as a substrate-specific adaptor
of the CUL-3 E3 ligase that targets MEI-1 for degrada-
tion via interaction by its MATH (meprin and TRAF ho-
mology) domain [14–16]. If the function of the CUL-3 E3
ligase is impaired by inactivating cul-3, mel-26, or rfl-1,
MEI-1 accumulates and the embryos show severe spin-
dle-positioning defects due to short astral microtu-
bules. Recent evidence suggests that BTB-containing
proteins may generally function as substrate-specific
adaptors, which contain diverse substrate-interacting
domains and specifically bind via their BTB motif to
Cullin3-based E3 ligase complexes [14–21]. Analogous
to SCF (Skp1-Cullin-F box)-type E3 ligase complexes
[22, 23], several BTB adaptors, including MEL-26, not
only target substrates like MEI-1 for degradation, but
are themselves degraded by the CUL-3 complex [14,
17, 24]. However, the physiological function of this au-
toregulatory mechanism is currently unclear [25].

While the role of the CUL-3/MEL-26 E3 ligase com-
plex for the regulation of the microtubule network is
beginning to emerge, the reason for the cortical hyper-
activity observed in rfl-1 mutant embryos is not under-
stood. As RNAi of actin regulators including the formin
cyk-1 and the myosin regulatory light chain mlc-4 sup-

press these ectopic furrow ingressions, they are likely
to be caused by an actin-driven process resembling the
formation of cytokinetic furrows [8]. This is further un-
derscored by the observation that embryos treated with
the microtubule-destabilizing drug nocodazole show
ectopic furrowing after onset of the first mitosis, but not
during pronuclear migration [8]. Thus, the elucidation of
the underlying defect of rfl-1 mutant embryos is likely
to unravel important new insights into the regulation of
cytokinesis independent of microtubule length or den-
sity. In this study, we investigated ectopic ruffling dur-
ing pronuclear migration in rfl-1 mutant embryos as a
model for contraction of the contractile ring. Interest-
ingly, we found that MEL-26 forms a complex with the
coronin-like protein POD-1 (polarity and osmotic sensi-
tivity defective) at cleavage furrows. MEL-26 is required
for efficient furrow ingression, e.g., contraction of the
actomyosin ring. Coronin and coronin-like proteins
have been implicated in crosslinking the actin and the
microtubule cytoskeleton in different organisms [26,
27]. Moreover, coronin in Dictyostelium and POD-1 in
C. elegans appear to be involved in cytokinesis [28, 29].
Our results imply that the BTB-containing protein MEL-
26 plays a dual role in the early C. elegans embryo.
First,
it acts as a substrate-specific adaptor in the
CUL-3 complex to degrade MEI-1, and second, it func-
tions as an activator of cytokinesis.

Results

Accumulation of MEL-26 Stimulates
Furrow Ingression
Inactivation of rfl-1(or198), an activator of the CUL-3 E3
ligase complex, leads to the occurrence of extra ingres-
sions during pronuclear migration and cytokinesis in
the early C. elegans embryo (Figure 1A; [8]). These inva-
ginations are stable over a long time and accumulate
the nonmuscle myosin NMY-2::GFP at their leading
edge (Figure 1A), implying that they involve an actin-
driven process. To quantify this defect, we counted all
cortical
ingressions during pronuclear migration that
persisted for at least 50 s (termed ruffles). We did not
count the two invaginations of the pseudocleavage fur-
row [30], which was observed in all analyzed wild-type
and mutant embryos. In wild-type embryos, no ruffles
were observed at 200 s before pronuclear meeting (time
0), while in rfl-1(RNAi) rfl-1(or198) mutants on average
over two ruffles were detected simultaneously (Figure
1B; Table 1). Efficient inactivation of rfl-1 was best
achieved by injecting dsRNA against rfl-1 into temper-
ature-sensitive (ts) rfl-1 animals. It has been argued that
short microtubules cause excessive furrowing during
and after the first mitosis [7], and indeed inactivation of
rfl-1 results in short microtubules, due to the accumula-
tion of the microtubule-severing protein MEI-1 [8]. How-
ever, mei-1(ct46gf) gain-of-function (gf) embryos, which
express a nondegradable form of MEI-1, did not show
excessive furrowing during pronuclear migration (Fig-
ure 1A and Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data avail-
able with this article online), although their microtubule
network is severed due to the accumulation of MEI-1.
Moreover, destabilization of the microtubule network
by inactivation of the microtubule-associated protein

(MAP) ZYG-9 [31, 32] by RNAi did not cause hyper-
contractility of the cortex (Figure 1A). Taken together,
these results demonstrate that short astral microtu-
bules unable to reach the embryo cortex are not suffi-
cient to cause ectopic furrowing during pronuclear
migration.

To test whether other components of the CUL-3 com-
plex are responsible for this cortical hypercontractility,
we inactivated the known components of the E3 ligase.
Importantly, depletion of CUL-3 by RNAi phenocopied
the hypercontractility phenotype of rfl-1 mutant em-
bryos (Figures 1A and 1B; Table 1; [8]), suggesting that
the accumulation of one or more CUL-3 targets could
account for this defect. Surprisingly, however, inactiva-
tion of mel-26 by RNAi in wild-type and several mel-
26(lf) backgrounds did not display hypercontractility,
excluding the possibility that accumulation of an un-
known target of the substrate-specific adaptor MEL-26
causes this defect. Like other substrate-specific adap-
tors [17, 22, 23, 33], MEL-26 has been shown to be
degraded within the CUL-3 ligase complex [14], imply-
ing that either MEL-26 itself or a CUL-3 ligase with a
BTB adaptor other than MEL-26 causes the observed
hypercontractile phenotype. To distinguish between
these two possibilities, we analyzed the hypercontrac-
tility of cul-3(RNAi) in mel-26(ct61sb4) embryos, which
has been reported to be a null mutant at the restric-
tive temperature [13]. Interestingly, cul-3(RNAi); mel-26
(ct61sb4) embryos exhibited reduced ruffling compared
to cul-3(RNAi) or rfl-1(RNAi) rfl-1(or198) embryos (Fig-
ures 1B and 1C), indicating that accumulation of MEL-
26 itself caused excessive ruffling. Because these ruf-
fles accumulate the nonmuscle myosin NMY-2::GFP,
and their occurrence is suppressed by depleting pro-
teins involved in cytokinesis [8], our results suggest
that MEL-26 may function as a positive regulator of cy-
tokinesis.

MEL-26 Is Required for Efficient Furrowing
during Cytokinesis
Because accumulation of MEL-26 appears to stimulate
furrowing, we next tested whether loss of MEL-26 func-
tion [mel-26(lf)] may lead to a defect in cytokinesis. To
circumvent the strong defects of mel-26(lf) due to the
stabilization of MEI-1 [13, 14], we exploited the recently
identified β-tubulin allele tbb-2(sb26), which acts as a
suppressor of mei-1(ct46gf) [34]. It has been shown
that this tubulin mutant is partially insensitive to the ac-
tivity of the microtubule-severing protein MEI-1, and
therefore the accumulation of MEI-1 is less deleterious
in the tbb-2(sb26) background [34].
Indeed, mei-
1(ct46gf); tbb-2(sb26) embryos showed only 32% le-
thality (Figure 2A), while 97% of the mei-1(ct46gf)
embryos failed to develop into viable worms under our
experimental conditions. Interestingly, mel-26(ct61sb4);
tbb-2(sb26) exhibited 73% embryonic lethality, and vir-
tually no (4%) viable cul-3(RNAi); mel-26(ct61sb4); tbb-
2(sb26) embryos could be recovered (Figure 2A). These
results imply that MEL-26 and CUL-3 must have essen-
tial functions other than degradation of MEI-1.

To characterize the additional function of MEL-26,
we analyzed the first mitotic cell divisions of mel-
26(ct61sb4); tbb-2(sb26) embryos by DIC time-lapse

(A) Analysis of cortical ruffling of wild-type and the indicated mutant embryos during pronuclear migration by live imaging using DIC micro-
scopy. Stable membrane ingressions (“ruffles”) that persisted for more than 50 s in addition to pseudocleavage formation are marked by
arrowheads. Note that ectopic furrows are not due to short microtubules, as they are absent in mei-1(ct46gf) reared at the nonpermissive
temperature of 25°C and in zyg-9(RNAi) embryos. In contrast to cul-3(RNAi) and rfl-1(RNAi) rfl-(or198) embryos, cortical ruffling was not
observed after inactivation of mel-26 [mel-26(RNAi) mel-26(or543lf)] embryos. The nonmuscle myosin NMY-2::GFP accumulates in the ectopic
ruffles in cul-3(RNAi) embryos (orange arrowheads).

stable invaginations that corresponded to the pseudocleavage furrow occurred in all embryos analyzed (see Figure 1A) and were not counted.

tion from the two-cell stage to a four-cell stage (Figure
2B and Movies S1–S3) after a shift for 3 hr to the re-
strictive temperature. No such defects were observed
in mei-1(ct46gf); tbb-2(sb26) (n = 7) or cul-3(RNAi); tbb-
2(sb26) (n = 6) embryos, confirming that this defect is
not caused by MEI-1 accumulation and/or incomplete
suppression by the tbb-2(sb26) allele. Some mel-
26(ct61sb4); tbb-2(sb26) embryos also displayed polar
body extrusion defects (Figure 2B), indicative of cytoki-
netic defects during meiosis. Thus, MEL-26 is required
for efficient cytokinesis.

To corroborate these cytokinetic defects, we com-
pared the timing of cleavage furrow ingression in wild-
type and mutant embryos at the one-cell stage. We first
measured the time between nuclear envelope break-
down (NEB) and the onset of ingression of the first cy-
tokinesis furrow. As shown in Figure 2C, the onset of
furrow ingression was significantly delayed in mel-26
(ct61sb4); tbb-2(sb26) mutants. In contrast, mei-1(ct46gf);
tbb-2(sb26) or cul-3(RNAi); tbb-2(sb26) embryos did not
show a significant difference to wild-type embryos in
the same assay. These data indicate that MEL-26 is re-
quired for timely furrow ingression during cytokinesis.
We next measured the time required for the ingression

(A) Embryonic lethality of mei-1 gain-of-function (ct46) and mel-26 loss-of-function (ct61sb4) mutants alone or in combination with the
β-tubulin mutant tbb-2(sb26), which is resistant to MEI-1 severing [34], was determined after shifting the worms for 3 hr to the restrictive
temperature (25°C; the error bars represent standard deviations).
(B) Wild-type or the indicated mutant embryos were analyzed by life imaging using DIC microscopy, and images are shown during pronuclear
migration (PNM) and the two-cell stage. Stars mark pronuclei during pronuclear migration, while arrowheads point to the position of the cen-
trosomes during the two-cell stage. Four out of twelve recorded mel-26(ct61sb4); tbb-2(sb26) embryos failed cytokinesis, resulting in the regression
of the cytokinesis furrow (top right). In some embryos, a cytokinetic defect had already appeared during meiosis, leading to the inability to
extrude polar bodies (the yellow star labels the granule-free area corresponding to an additional pronucleus).
(C) The time (in seconds) between nuclear envelope breakdown and the start of furrow ingression was determined by DIC microscopy in
wild-type (n = 8) and the indicated mutant embryos [cul-3(RNAi); tbb-2(sb26) (n = 6), mel-26(ct61sb4); tbb-2(sb26) (n = 7), mei-1(ct46); tbb-
2(sb26) (n = 7)]. Embryos carrying a loss-of-function allele of mel-26 show a statistically significant delay (star) in furrow ingression (p < 0.05;
error bars depict standard deviations).
(D) The time (in seconds) of furrow ingression was determined by DIC microscopy in wild-type and the indicated mutant embryos at the one-
cell stage (P0 blastomere) and two-cell stage (blastomeres AB and P1). Note that furrows ingress significantly more slowly (star) in mel-

of the cleavage furrow in P0 at the one-cell stage, and
AB and P1 blastomeres at the two-cell stage (Figure
2D).
Interestingly, furrow ingression takes significantly
longer in mel-26(ct61sb4); tbb-2(sb26) mutant embryos,
implying that not only the onset of furrowing but also
the speed of furrow ingression is affected by MEL-26.
Inactivation of activators of the actomyosin ring such
as the Rho binding kinase, which phosphorylates myo-
sin, were previously shown to display similar defects in
furrow ingression [35]. We conclude from these results
that MEL-26 functions as a positive regulator of cytoki-
nesis by controlling the initiation and duration of the
cleavage furrow ingression.

MEL-26 Accumulates at the Cleavage Furrow
in Mutants Defective for CUL-3 Ligase Activity
To determine the subcellular localization of MEL-26, we
performed indirect immunofluorescence on embryos
using affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies raised against
full-length recombinant MEL-26 [14]. MEL-26 localized
to the cytoplasm and accumulated at the site of cell
separation during cytokinesis (Figures 3A and 3C). No
staining of cell-cell contact sites was detectable in mel-
26(RNAi) embryos, demonstrating that the antibodies
are specific for MEL-26. Moreover, a similar expression
pattern was observed in embryos expressing a MEL-
26::GFP fusion protein (data not shown). The staining

Figure 3. MEL-26 Localizes to the Cleavage Furrow and Accumulates at the Cell Cortex in cul-3(RNAi) and rfl-1(or198) Embryos
(A and C) MEL-26 was localized in wild-type and the indicated mutant embryos by indirect immunofluorescence using affinity-purified MEL-
26 antibodies and photographed by fluorescence microscopy. In cul-3(RNAi) or rfl-1(RNAi) rfl-1(or198) embryos, MEL-26 also accumulated
at the cortex (arrows). The centrosomal staining occasionally observed with anti-MEL-26 antibodies is not specific, as it was also observed
in embryos depleted for MEL-26 by RNAi. The DNA was stained by Hoechst as described in the Experimental Procedures. The arrowheads
in (C) point to tips of ingressing cleavage furrows during mitosis (top and bottom panels) and ruffles during pronuclear migration (middle
panel). (B) The accumulation of MEL-26 was analyzed in wild-type, rfl-1(or198), and mel-26(RNAi) embryo extracts by immunoblotting with
MEL-26 antibodies (upper panel); immunoblotting with antibodies against tubulin served as a loading control (lower panel).

of the centrosomes was nonspecific and varied from
one purified antiserum to the other. Strikingly, MEL-26
greatly accumulated at cell-cell contact sites and
spread to the cortex in embryos depleted for either
CUL-3 or its activator, RFL-1 (Figure 3A). An accumula-
tion of MEL-26 was also observed by Western blotting
of an embryonic extract made from rfl-1(or198) worms
shifted to the restrictive temperature (Figure 3B). These
results confirm that degradation of MEL-26 requires an
intact CUL-3 ligase complex and suggest that binding
to CUL-3 is not required for its cortical
localization.
MEL-26 was not just localized to the membrane region
that separates two cells but was also observed on in-
gressing cleavage furrows in wild-type embryos and
accumulated at ectopic ruffles and at sites of upcoming
cytokinesis when the CUL-3 complex was impaired
(Figure 3C). Because the accumulation of MEL-26 at
the cleavage furrow and the cortex correlates with the
ectopic furrowing phenotype for rfl-1(RNAi) rfl-1(or198lf)
and cul-3(RNAi) described in Figure 1, these results
support the conclusion that MEL-26 promotes cytoki-

nesis by performing a specific function on the cleav-
age furrow.

MEL-26 Physically Interacts with the F-Actin
Binding Protein POD-1
To gain molecular insight into the mechanism of MEL-
26’s function during cytokinesis, we searched for in-
teracting proteins using a yeast two-hybrid screen. As
expected, we found MEI-1, which has previously been
shown to physically interact with MEL-26 [14], and
MEL-26, which like other BTB proteins is known to ho-
modimerize [36, 37]. Importantly, MEL-26 also inter-
acted with POD-1, an actin binding protein containing
two coronin-like domains connected by a short linker
region [29]. The POD-1 fragment interacting with MEL-
26 identified in the two-hybrid screen contained the en-
tire second coronin domain and the linker region (Figure
4A). To biochemically confirm the interaction between
MEL-26 and POD-1, we in vitro translated full-length
POD-1 in reticulocyte lysates in the presence of radio-
actively labeled 35S-methionine and tested for its asso-

Figure 4. POD-1 Binds to MEL-26 and Is Required to Localize MEL-26 to the Cleavage Furrow
(A) POD-1 was isolated in a two-hybrid screen using MEL-26 as a bait, and the expression of the β-galactosidase two-hybrid reporter is
shown by filter assay in cells harboring either an empty control plasmid or a plasmid expressing the Gal4 activation domain (AD) fused to the
second coronin domain and the linker region of POD-1 as schematically indicated on the right.
(B) Full-length POD-1 as indicated schematically on the right was radiolabeled by in vitro translation and incubated with either glutathione
S-transferase (GST) or GST-MEL-26 fusion protein. Bound proteins were eluted and separated on SDS-PAGE (“Pellet” fraction, “P”). One-
tenth of the supernatant was loaded (“Sup” fraction, “S”) for control. POD-1 was visualized by radiography (upper panel), while the Coomassie
blue-stained gel is included for control.
(C) The localization of POD-1 was determined at the indicated stages by immunofluorescence with affinity-purified POD-1 antibodies in wild-
type (upper two rows) and mel-26(or543) mutants (lower two rows). A monoclonal α-tubulin antibody was used to visualize the microtubule
network.
(D) POD-1 levels were analyzed by immunoblotting of extracts prepared from wild-type, cul-3(RNAi), or mel-26(RNAi) embryos with affinity-
purified POD-1 antibodies (upper panel). Tubulin was used as a loading control (lower panel).
(E) The localization of MEL-26 was determined at the indicated stages by immunofluorescence with affinity-purified MEL-26 antibodies in
wild-type (upper row) and pod-1(ye11) mutants (lower two rows). A monoclonal α-tubulin antibody was used to visualize the microtubule

ciation with bacterially expressed GST-MEL-26. Indeed,
POD-1 was specifically pulled down by GST-MEL-26
but did not significantly associate with GST alone (Fig-
ure 4B). Taken together, these results suggest that
MEL-26 physically interacts with the coronin-like pro-
tein POD-1.

The Localization of MEL-26 to Cleavage
Furrows Depends on POD-1
MEL-26 (Figure 3) and POD-1 [29] both localize to the
cortex and cleavage furrows during cytokinesis. To
address whether this cortical
localization is interde-
pendent, we performed indirect immunofluorescence

experiments in wild-type and mutant embryos with af-
finity-purified antibodies against POD-1 and MEL-26
(Figures 4C and 4E). For control, the embryos were also
stained with a monoclonal antibody against tubulin
(right panels). As shown in Figure 4C, the cortical local-
ization of POD-1 was independent of MEL-26. Because
the localization of POD-1 requires an intact actin cy-
toskeleton (data not shown), this result implies that
mel-26(or543) embryos do not exhibit strongly aberrant
actin cables. Unlike MEI-1, POD-1 levels did not accu-
mulate in embryos with reduced MEL-26 or CUL-3
levels (Figure 4D), demonstrating that at least the bulk
fraction of POD-1 is not degraded by the CUL-3/MEL-

(A and B) The interaction between wild-type and the C94Y mutant of MEL-26 fused to the Gal4 activation domain (AD) was examined by two-
hybrid assay with MEL-26, POD-1, and MEI-1 fused to the LexA-DNA binding domain (BD). An empty plasmid was included for control. The
expression of the β-galactosidase two-hybrid reporter was analyzed by filter assay. The domain structure of MEL-26 and the interaction with
MEI-1, CUL-3, and POD-1 is schematically indicated in (B). The C94Y mutation lies within the MATH domain of MEL-26.
(C) The localization of MEL-26 was determined by immunofluorescence with affinity-purified MEL-26 antibodies in wild-type (upper row) and
mel-26(sb45) mutant embryos (lower row). DNA was visualized by Hoechst staining. Note that an intact MATH domain is required to localize
MEL-26 to the cleavage furrow (marked by arrowheads).

conclude that binding of MEL-26 to POD-1 is required
to recruit or maintain MEL-26 at the cleavage furrow
during cytokinesis.

Binding of MEL-26 to POD-1 at the Cortex
May Be Required for Hypercontractility
of the Cortex in cul-3(RNAi) Embryos
To address the functional importance of the MEL-26/
POD-1 complex for furrowing, we first screened the
available mel-26 alleles for defects in POD-1 binding.
Interestingly, the mel-26(sb45) allele harbors a specific
point mutant in the MATH domain, which changes cys-
teine 94 to a tyrosine residue (Figure 5B). This MEL-26
mutant abolished its binding to POD-1 and MEI-1, while
it was still able to homodimerize and interact with
CUL-3 (Figure 5A and [14, 15]). The MEL-26(C94Y) pro-
tein was expressed at the expected size, and its levels
were not elevated (Figure 5D), confirming that MEL-
26(C94Y) is efficiently degraded by the CUL-3 complex.
Strikingly, however, the MEL-26(C94Y) protein failed to

accumulate at the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis
(Figure 5C). In 60% of the 20 analyzed embryos, we
failed to detect MEL-26 staining at cell-cell contacts,
whereas 40% showed a strongly reduced signal. In
comparison, 75% of wild-type embryos displayed a
strong signal, and 25% a weak signal (n = 20). This sup-
ports the notion that binding of MEL-26 to POD-1 is
necessary for its cortical localization in vivo.

To test whether binding of MEL-26 to POD-1 is re-
quired for its function in furrowing, we compared
ectopic ruffling in cul-3(RNAi) and cul-3(RNAi); mel-
26(sb45) embryos. As quantified in Figure 5E, ectopic
hypercontractility was strongly reduced in mel-26(sb45)
mutants unable to interact with POD-1, which strength-
ens the argument that MEL-26 is required at the cortex
for ectopic furrowing to occur. Like MEL-26, loss of
POD-1 function leads to cytokinesis failure (Figure 4E,
AB blastomere at the two-cell stage; and data not
shown), although we can not exclude that the osmotic
imbalance of pod-1(lf) embryos could contribute to this
cytokinesis defect [29]. Taken together, these results
suggest that POD-1 recruits MEL-26 to the cortex via
its MATH domain and that the MEL-26/POD-1 complex

Figure 6. MEL-26 Regulates the Actin and Microtubule Cytoskele-
ton by CUL-3-Dependent and -Independent Mechanisms
MEL-26 functions as a substrate-specific adaptor of the CUL-3
complex to target the katanin-like protein MEI-1 for degradation,
thereby allowing the formation of long astral microtubules (left
panel). In addition, MEL-26 associates with the actin binding pro-
tein POD-1 at the cleavage furrow to promote cytokinesis in a CUL-
3-independent manner (right panel). The accumulation of MEL-26
is prevented by the CUL-3 E3 ligase, which in turn is regulated by
the RFL-1 neddylation pathway.

at the cell cortex promotes efficient initiation and in-
gression of the cytokinesis furrow in vivo.

Discussion

In this study, we identify the BTB protein MEL-26 as a
positive regulator of furrow ingression during cytokine-
sis in C. elegans embryos. Surprisingly, this novel MEL-
26 function is independent of its well-described role as
a substrate-specific adaptor in CUL-3 E3 ligase com-
plexes.
Instead, we found that MEL-26 is itself a
physiological substrate of the CUL-3 complex, and its
cortical accumulation induces ectopic furrowing by a
CUL-3-independent mechanism. MEL-26 localizes to
the ingressing cleavage furrow and forms a complex
with the actin binding protein POD-1. Thus, MEL-26
functions as a key regulator of first the microtubule
network by degrading the microtubule-severing protein
MEI-1, and second the actin network by binding to
POD-1 (Figure 6).

MEL-26 Promotes Furrow Ingression during
Cytokinesis in a Complex with the Actin
Binding Protein POD-1
Based on the following criteria, we conclude that MEL-
26 functions as a physiological activator of cytokinesis.
First, MEL-26 localizes to ruffles during pronuclear mi-
gration and accumulates at the ingressing cleavage fur-
row during cytokinesis. Second, loss of MEL-26 func-
tion leads to cytokinetic defects. While MEL-26 is not
required for correct positioning of the cleavage furrow,
it is involved in the timing of initiation and speed of
furrow ingression. In addition, MEL-26 may play a role
during termination of cytokinesis, as the furrow re-
gresses in a substantial number of mel-26(lf) embryos
[25% of mel-26(ct61sb4); tbb-2 embryos]. Finally, accu-
mulation of MEL-26 at the cortex correlates with the
induction of ectopic ruffles (stable membrane invagi-
nations) during pronuclear migration. These ruffles re-

semble bona fide cytokinesis furrows, as they accumu-
late nonmuscle myosin and their formation requires
proteins known to be involved in cytokinesis such as
the formin CYK-1. MEL-26 is degraded in a CUL-3-
dependent manner [14], and high MEL-26 levels corre-
late with ruffling. Moreover, embryos expressing a MEL-
26 mutant that can no longer accumulate at cleavage
furrows did not show ruffling, demonstrating that MEL-
26 itself promotes furrowing. Accumulation of MEL-26
at ingressing furrows acts most likely in concert with
the local minima of astral microtubules to induce ec-
topic furrows, because ruffling was always observed in
embryos that contained short microtubules and ele-
vated levels of MEL-26. Because lack of degradation of
MEL-26 in cul-3(RNAi) or rfl-1 embryos triggers ectopic
furrows, it appears that MEL-26 is a rate-limiting com-
ponent for cytokinesis.

What molecular function may be performed by MEL-
26 during cytokinesis? Interestingly, we found that
MEL-26 forms a complex with the coronin-like protein
POD-1. Like other coronins, POD-1 binds to F-actin in
vitro and requires filamentous actin to localize to the
cortex in vivo (data not shown). Likewise, Dictyostelium
mutants lacking coronin are impaired in cytokinesis and
remodeling of the cortical actin cytoskeleton [28]. Yeast
coronin (Crn1p) promotes the rapid barbed-end assem-
bly of actin filaments and crosslinks filaments into bun-
dles and more complex networks [26]. Surprisingly, the
actin-destabilizing drugs cytochalasin D and latrunculin
A do not inhibit cytokinesis when released at the cleav-
age furrow, but rather promote it (reviewed by [38]). In
contrast, release of cytochalasin D near the spindle
poles leads to inhibition of cytokinesis, suggesting that
the cortex is under tension achieved by the actin cy-
toskeleton and associated proteins. Coronin has been
shown to function throughout the cortex during cytoki-
nesis [39], and POD-1 may thus be required for creating
cortical tension by crosslinking actin. Because MEL-26
binds to POD-1 specifically at the cleavage furrow, we
speculate that it may lower POD-1’s F-actin cross-
linking capacity by blocking the second coronin do-
main. This is consistent with the view that a dynamic
F-actin network is required to promote cytokinesis.
Alternatively, POD-1 may only recruit MEL-26 to the
cortex, which in turn regulates the activity of other
components such as myosin or regulators of the RhoA-
GTPase, which are required to initiate furrow ingres-
sion. Further work is needed to distinguish between
these speculative models.

Short Astral Microtubules Are Not Sufficient
to Induce Cortical Ruffling
Although it is clear that the mitotic spindle signals the
position of the cleavage furrow during anaphase, few
unifying cytokinetic principles have been discovered. In
bigger cells like sand dollar eggs or the early C. elegans
embryo, the focus for site specification relies on astral
microtubules reaching the cell cortex [5, 7, 40], which
may play an inhibitory role in furrow ingression by an
as yet unknown mechanism. Based on this model, it
has been argued that the cortical ruffling in rfl-1(lf) em-
bryos may result only from short microtubules [41].
These ruffles are stable actin-driven ingressions of the

The Double Life of the Substrate Adaptor MEL-26

cortex, which resemble cytokinesis furrows. Our results
demonstrate that a low density of astral microtubules
is not sufficient to induce ectopic ruffling in C. elegans
during pronuclear migration. First, embryos with desta-
bilized astral microtubules after inactivation of zyg-9
do not show increased ruffling. Second, mei-1(gf) or
mel-26(null) embryos exhibit short astral microtubules
because of stable MEI-1, but they do not ruffle during
pronuclear migration. Moreover, astral microtubules
reaching the cortex are not sufficient to prevent cortical
ruffling, as inactivation of cul-3 in tbb-2(sb26) embryos
exhibit increased cortical activity (data not shown), al-
though to a lesser degree than cul-3(RNAi) in wild-type
controls. Thus, while the local minima of astral microtu-
bules may contribute to induce ectopic ruffling or posi-
tioning of the cleavage furrow, additional mechanisms
must exist to regulate the timing and speed of furrow
ingression during cytokinesis. The cortical activity reg-
ulated by MEL-26 may be particularly important during
pronuclear migration, while microtubule density may be
crucial after the first cytokinesis. This developmental
control could explain why nocodazole-treated embryos
show ectopic furrowing only after the first mitosis.

Dual Role of MEL-26: Cytokinesis Inducer
and Substrate-Specific Adaptor
Previous studies have established that the BTB protein
MEL-26 functions as a substrate-specific adaptor protein
of CUL-3 to degrade the katanin-like protein MEI-1 at the
meiosis-to-mitosis transition [14]. Several lines of evi-
dence now suggest that the substrate adaptor MEL-26
is a physiological CUL-3 substrate and also functions
independently of the CUL-3 ligase complex as a posi-
tive regulator of cytokinesis (Figure 6). First, MEL-26
localizes to the ingressing cleavage furrow during cyto-
kinesis and strongly accumulates in cul-3(RNAi) and
rfl-1(lf) embryos. Second, ectopic ruffling of cul-3(RNAi)
and rfl-1(lf) embryos during pronuclear migration re-
quires MEL-26, and finally, mel-26 mutant embryos
exhibit cytokinesis defects that are independent of
MEI-1. We thus conclude that the CUL-3-based E3 li-
gase regulates cytokinesis by allowing MEL-26 to accu-
mulate only at the right time and place. Thus, MEL-26
has two distinct functions in the early embryo, i.e., it
regulates the microtubule cytoskeleton by degrading
the katanin-like protein MEI-1 and functions as an in-
ducer of cortical contractions in concert with the actin
binding protein POD-1 (Figure 6). Why a single protein
governs the regulation of these two cytoskeletal pro-
cesses is not immediately apparent, but it may allow
coordination of the assembly of a mitotic spindle and
the onset of cytokinesis.

We demonstrate that BTB-containing proteins not
only function as substrate-specific adaptors to target
interacting proteins for degradation, but also can be
substrates themselves, which play additional functions
independent of the CUL-3 ligase complex (Figure 6).
Importantly, our results thus provide a physiological
role for the autocatalytic degradation observed for
MEL-26 [14]. Dual roles of substrate adaptors function-
ing in other cullin-based ligases have also been de-
scribed, suggesting that our findings are of general
importance. For example, the SOCS box-containing

protein VHL functions as a substrate adaptor to de-
grade the transcription factor Hif1α during normoxia
[42] but also regulates the microtubule network inde-
pendently of the Cul2 ligase [43]. Moreover, the F box
proteins Ctf13p [44] and Rcy1p [45] both interact with
Skp1p but serve functions independent of the Cdc53p/
Cul1-based E3 ligase. Interestingly, Ctf13p was pro-
posed to exist in two pools: the soluble pool of Ctf13p
is degraded via the SCFCdc4p-complex [46], while the
kinetochore-associated fraction is protected from deg-
radation [46]. Similarly, cortical MEL-26 could be pro-
tected from degradation by binding to POD-1 and pro-
mote cytokinesis in a CUL-3-independent manner,
while the unstable cytoplasmic pool of MEL-26 associ-
ates with CUL-3 to degrade MEI-1 (Figure 6). Surpris-
ingly, the interaction of MEL-26 with POD-1 and MEI-1
requires the same domain, but only MEI-1 serves as a
substrate of the CUL-3/MEL-26 complex in vivo.

In conclusion, as demonstrated for MEL-26 and VHL,
bona fide substrate adaptors of cullin-based ligases
may thus themselves be substrates and perform cullin-
dependent and independent functions. Therefore, a
careful molecular analysis will be necessary to deter-
mine whether an F box-, SOCS box-, or BTB-containing
protein indeed functions as a substrate-specific adap-
tor in a cullin-based ligase or serves a cullin-indepen-
dent role in a physiological context.

Experimental Procedures

S. cerevisiae Strains and Manipulations
Yeast was handled following standard protocols [47, 48].

For the two-hybrid screen, MAV103 [49] cells were transformed
with a cDNA library (Invitrogen), which was prepared from different
developmental stages of the C. elegans isolate N2 and fused to the
Gal activation domain using the plasmid pPC86. The bait plasmid
contained MEL-26 fused to the DNA binding domain vector pPC97.
β-galactosidase assays were performed on nitrocellulose filters [50].

C. elegans Strains and Manipulations
C. elegans Bristol N2 was used as wild-type. All strains were grown
at 15°C under standard conditions [51], and temperature-sensitive
strains were shifted to the restrictive temperature (25°C) as indi-
cated. The following genes and alleles were used: mei-1(ct46), rfl-
1(or198), mel-26(or543), mel-26(or184), mel-26(ct61sb4),
tbb-
2(sb26), pod-1(ye11), unc-29(e1072), unc-32(e189). The transgene
zuls45(nmy-2::NMY-2::GFP) was used to visualize nonmuscle myo-
sin [52].

Microscopy and Immunocytochemistry
A Zeiss Axiovert 200M equipped with DIC optics and a Hamamatsu
Orca-ER camera was used for time-lapse recording. Worms were
cut open in M9 and mounted on a 3% agarose pad [8] or hung on
a poly-L-lysine-coated coverslip. For immunofluorescence, worms
were cut open in M9 directly on a poly-L-lysine-coated slide. The
eggshell was permeabilized by flipping off the coverslip (freeze-
cracked), fixed for 20 min in methanol at room temperature, and
subsequently blocked for 20 min in 1× PBS, 0.2% Tween, and 1%
BSA. Primary antibodies were incubated overnight. Secondary an-
tibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes and were applied
for 45 min at 37°C [8]. The slides were analyzed either by a Zeiss
Axiovert 200M or by a Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal microscope.

RNA-Mediated Interference
RNAi by injection against rfl-1 was performed by amplifying the fifth
exon from a cDNA two-hybrid library (Invitrogen) via T7 primers.
Constructs for cul-3(RNAi) and mel-26(RNAi) were described [14].
Embryo extracts from cul-3(RNAi), rfl-1(RNAi), and mel-26(RNAi)
were prepared after feeding L4 animals for 48 hr on 1 mM IPTG-

Current Biology

containing NGM plates at 15° with bacteria (HT115) transformed
with the corresponding feeding vector.

Protein Extracts, Antibodies, and Immunoblotting
Embryo extracts and immunoblotting were carried out as de-
scribed [9]. The following antibodies were used in this study: anti-
MEL-26 [14], anti-POD-1 (this study), and anti-α-tubulin (Sigma).
Polyclonal rabbit antibodies were raised against an amino-terminal
fragment of POD-1 (amino acids 1–336). The anti-POD-1 antibody
was affinity purified over immobilized GST-POD-1, eluted with 100
mM glycine (pH 2.6), and subsequently neutralized with 60 mM Tris
(pH 8.8). Secondary antibodies were purchased from BioRad and
were used following the instructions of the manufacturer.

Expression and Purification of GST Fusion
Proteins for Immunization
The vector pGEX4T-1 (Pharmacia) was used to express an N-ter-
minal GST fusion protein of POD-1 in E.coli BL21. Inclusion bodies
were prepared and loaded onto SDS-PAGE according to standard
procedures. Fusion proteins were cut out of the SDS-PAGE gel,
electroeluted, and used for immunization of rabbits (Domaine des
Dombes, France).

In Vitro Binding Assays
Binding assays with in vitro-translated POD-1 and GST-MEL-26 ex-
pressed in E. coli were carried out as described previously [14].

Statistical Analysis
The likelihood that two data sets originate from the same distribu-
tion was tested with a two-tailed, heteroscedastic Student’s t test.
