Summary

The membranes of all eukaryotic motile (9 + 2) and
immotile primary (9 + 0) cilia harbor channels and re-
ceptors involved in sensory transduction (reviewed
by [1]). These membrane proteins are transported
from the cytoplasm onto the ciliary membrane by ves-
icles targeted for exocytosis at a point adjacent to
the ciliary basal body [2, 3]. Here, we use time-lapse
fluorescence microscopy to demonstrate that select
GFP-tagged sensory receptors undergo rapid vecto-
rial transport along the entire length of the cilia of
Caenorhabditis elegans sensory neurons. Transient
receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV) channels OSM-9
and OCR-2 [4, 5] move in ciliary membranes at rates
comparable to the intraflagellar transport (IFT) ma-
chinery located between the membrane and the un-
derlying axonemal microtubules [6–8]. OSM-9 motility
is disrupted in certain IFT mutant backgrounds. Sur-
prisingly, motility of
receptor potential
polycystin (TRPP) channel PKD-2 (polycystic kidney
disease-2) [9], a mechano-receptor [10], was not de-
tected. Our study demonstrates that IFT, previously
shown to be necessary for transport of axonemal
components [11], is also involved in the motility of
TRPV membrane protein movement along cilia of C. ele-
gans sensory cells.

Results and Discussion

Ciliary membrane proteins, synthesized on the rough
endoplasmic reticulum, move from the Golgi in vesicles
along microtubule tracks to a position adjacent to the
ciliary basal body, where they undergo exocytosis [2,
3]. From the site of exocytosis, they are able to reach
the cilia [3] and spread throughout the ciliary mem-
brane either by diffusion or a motor-dependent motility
mechanism. To directly observe the dynamics of motil-
ity of ciliary membrane proteins, we used transgenic
Caenorhabditis elegans animals expressing GFP-tagged
OSM-9 and OCR-2 TRPV channels. These two mem-
brane proteins are located on sensory cilia, where they
function in several sensory-transduction modalities, in-

cluding osmosensation, chemosensation, olfaction,
and mechanosensation [4, 5]. Proper targeting to the
cilia and functioning of these proteins requires the pres-
ence of both proteins, suggesting that they form a pro-
tein complex [5]. When observed by time-lapse fluores-
cence microscopy, both OSM-9::GFP and OCR-2::
GFP moved bidirectionally in sensory cilia (Figures 1
and 2 and Table 1; also Movie S1 available with this
article online). The rate of movement toward the tip was
slower than the rate toward the cell body (Table 1), as
reported for intraflagellar transport (IFT) [8]. To further
compare OSM-9 and OCR-2 movement to IFT, we ana-
lyzed the rates of anterograde and retrograde move-
ment in the cilia of the IFT particle polypeptide OSM-6
(IFT52)::GFP (Table 1). In both directions the rate of
movement of OSM-9 and OCR-2 was similar to that of
IFT, suggesting that IFT is responsible for this motility.
However, in contrast to the continuous movement of
IFT particles along the entire length of cilia, OSM-9 and
OCR-2 motility was saltatory and more obvious in the dis-
tal part of the cilium than in the proximal segment.
OSM-9 and OCR-2 motility is, therefore, qualitatively dif-
ferent than the continuous movement of the IFT particles.
IFT is a motility process required for the assembly
and maintenance of most eukaryotic cilia (reviewed by
[12]). It has been shown to be required for the transport
of axonemal precursors to the flagellar-tip assembly
site and for the transport of turnover products back to
the base [11], but its role in moving ciliary membrane
proteins has not been demonstrated. To determine if
IFT is involved in the vectorial transport of these TRPV
channels in cilia, we examined the motility of OSM-
9::GFP in IFT-defective mutants. We selected mutants
that still possessed sensory cilia, enabling us to visual-
ize GFP-tagged proteins in the cilia. The mutant back-
grounds used included daf-10(p821) and che-3(e1124),
which encode the C. elegans homologs of IFT complex
A protein IFT122 and the retrograde IFT motor cyto-
plasmic dynein 1b heavy chain (DHC), respectively [8,
13, 14]. We also examined the effect of mutations in
kinesin-2 and OSM-3 kinesin, two anterograde IFT mo-
tors [15], on OSM-9 movement. Complex B polypeptide
mutants, e.g., osm-6 (IFT52), osm-5 (IFT88), and osm-
1(IFT172), were not amenable to analysis because cilia
of this class of mutants are extremely stunted [16, 14],
and their use in these motility studies is thus prohibited.
In the cilia of wild-type animals, OSM-9::GFP is
evenly distributed along the cilium (Figure 3) and moves
at a rate similar to IFT (Figure 1 and Table1). In both
daf-10 and che-3 mutants, however, OSM-9::GFP accu-
mulates in aggregates along the length of the cilium
and at the base of the cilium and is not detected mov-
ing in the cilium (Figure 3 and data not shown). These
results indicate that IFT is required for the proper distri-
bution and movement of these TRPV membrane chan-
nels in the cilium (Figure 3). Moreover, the fact that
OCR-2 and OSM-9 are still in the cilia of the mutants,
but are not moving, and that these organisms have sen-
sory defects is suggestive that the motility of these
channels is important for the sensory activity of the

cilia. In all figures, cilia are oriented with the proximal-distal axis
running from bottom to top. For orientation purposes, (A1) is a fluo-
rescence micrograph of phasmid cilia (yellow box) in the C. elegans
hermaphrodite tail. White lines were drawn to illustrate the outline
of the animal’s body. (A2) is a higher magnification of the region
used to record the movie (see Supplemental Data), and the yellow
rectangle demarcates the region used to generate the montage in

cilia. In Chlamydmonas, IFT is indeed required for fla-
gellar sensory-signal transduction; when IFT is de-
fective, mating cannot be completed even in the pres-
ence of structurally normal flagella [17].

Kinesin-2 and OSM-3-kinesin act cooperatively to
build cilia on amphid neurons [15]. To our surprise, in
the phasmid cilia (sensory cilia in the tail of the worm),
OSM-9::GFP appears to move at near wild-type rates
in the anterograde motor single-mutant backgrounds,
including kap-1(ok676), klp-11(tm324), and osm-3(p802)
(Table 2). Similarly, a mutation in a single anterograde
IFT motor subunit does not stop IFT particle antero-
grade movements in C. elegans [15]. This differs from
the effect of anterograde IFT motor mutations in Chla-
mydomonas flagella, where similar mutations in antero-
grade IFT motor subunits abolish IFT particle move-
ment [18] as well as the movement of membrane
proteins (J.L.R. and K. Huang, unpublished data). The
reason for the difference in effect of mutation in IFT
anterograde kinesin motors on the movement of IFT
particles and membrane proteins in C. elegans and
Chlamydomonas flagella is probably that C. elegans
has two overlapping anterograde motors [15], whereas
Chlamydomonas has only one [18].

A third membrane channel, the TRPP mechanorecep-
tor channel PKD-2 [9], was examined for movement.
PKD is found throughout the cilia of male-specific sen-
sory neurons but mostly concentrates at the cilia base,
which correlates to the distal-most dendrite and basal-
body/transition-zone regions (Figure 4). In the IFT Com-
plex B polypeptide mutant osm-5, the accumulation of
PKD-2 in the membranes of stunted cilia is even more
dramatic ([14], data not shown), suggesting that IFT
plays a role in distributing PKD-2 throughout the cilia
and/or recycling TRPP channels out of the cilia. To test
this directly, we observed PKD-2::GFP within the cilia
of wild-type males; we failed to detect any movement
of PKD-2. These results suggest that, in contrast to the
active transport of OSM-9 and OCR-2, PKD-2 is teth-
ered, principally at the ciliary base, and is not actively
moved by IFT, and the small amount that is in the cilium
proper gets there by diffusion.

Thus, there are two obvious differences between the
two TRPV channels, OSM-9 and OCR-2, and the TRPP
PKD2 channel
in the cilia: The former move and are

found uniformly distributed along the cilium, whereas
the latter does not move, is greatly enriched at the cilia
base, and is present at much lower and variable levels
along the length of the cilium. These differences may
be due to the nature of the receptors. OSM-9 and OCR-2
are involved in chemosensation as demonstrated by
the inability of the mutants to perceive and respond to
changes in osmolarity and chemical stimuli. On the
other hand, mammalian PKD2/polycystin 2 acts as a
mechanosensor in the kidney, where it is found on the
primary cilia of renal epithelial cells that sense fluid flow
[19] and mediates calcium influx in response to physio-
logical fluid flow [10]. What stimulates PKD2 in C. ele-
gans is less clear, but mechanosensation could be in-

volved in locating the vulva [20], the mating process in
which PKD-2 is known to function [9]. These differ-
ences in function of the channels could explain their
different distribution and motilities. The chemosensors
are moving and spread all over the cilium to maximize
the amount of external medium with which they come
in contact. The mechanosensors are concentrated near
the base of the cilium (Figure 4), the ideal location to
sense and react to movements of the cilium.

Why might the movement of channels and receptors
be important for certain ciliary sensory function? The
movement could provide a mechanism for receptors or
channels to communicate with signaling molecules lo-
calized around the basal body/centriole, where there is

[21–23], such as the protein kinases involved in signal-
ing pathways controlling the cell cycle [24]. In this man-
ner, sensory receptors and the IFT machinery may initi-
ate retrograde signaling from the environment, along
the cilium, through the dendrite, and finally to the cell
body and nucleus.

In addition, ciliary movement of membrane receptors
may serve as a mechanism to control the number, activ-
ity, and turnover of receptors and channels on the cili-

ary membrane. In the outer segment of mammalian
photoreceptors, rapid protein turnover is essential for
normal cellular maintenance, with defects in IFT result-
ing in retinal degeneration [25, 26].

IFT is a motility process that is fundamental to all
aspects of ciliary assembly, maintenance, and function.
Inhibiting IFT may stop the movement of membrane
proteins because they are cargo of this transport sys-
tem as suggested by the results of this study; alterna-
tively, the effect may be less direct. Membrane proteins
may move by an uncharacterized motor, and their
movement may stop because of the general infirmity of
the cilia with attenuated IFT. IFT-dependent movement
of ciliary membrane proteins has also been seen in
Chlamydomonas ([6]; J.L.R. and K. Huang, unpublished
data), and it may be that in this organism in which the
flagella can be isolated, the binding partners of these
membrane proteins and the motors responsible for their
movement will be identified.
