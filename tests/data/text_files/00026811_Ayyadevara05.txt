Introduction

The complete oxidation of food using molecular oxygen as the
ultimate  electron  acceptor,  with  the  concomitant  capture  of
free energy released in the process, was a major evolutionary
innovation.  It  is  likely  that  the  switch  from  fermentative  to
oxidative metabolism permitted many salient features of extant
life  forms,  including  size,  mobility,  predation,  nervous  system
function and perhaps even multicellularity (Lane, 2002). These
advances  came,  however,  at  a  price.  A  small  but  significant
fraction of electrons flowing through the mitochondrial respir-
atory chain prematurely leaks to molecular oxygen and forms
the superoxide radical and other ‘reactive oxygen species’ (ROS)
(Cadenas  &  Davies,  2000).  Other  biochemical  and  physical
processes also generate ROS, either as byproducts or as part of
their function. Mitochondria are usually the predominant ROS
producers. In contrast to the dioxygen molecule, ROS and their
downstream  products  such  as  peroxynitrite  (Crow,  2000)  are
highly  reactive  and  readily  damage  cellular  constituents.  If
unopposed by appropriate defense mechanisms, ROS create a
state of oxidative stress that has been implicated in the etiology
of  a  variety  of  diseases,  most  of  which  are  degenerative
(Scandalios, 1997; Mates 
., 2005), and
in aging (Harman, 1956, 2003; Beckman & Ames, 1998; Cadenas
& Davies, 2000).

., 1999; McEwen 

et al

et al

The  considerable  reactivity  of  some  ROS  leads  to  their  low
selectivity. Although all cellular constituents can be targets of
ROS, radical-initiated reaction with polyunsaturated fatty acids
is  unique  because  it  results  in  a  chain  reaction  (Gutteridge  &
Halliwell, 1990). The resulting amplification of the original insult
may be of biological significance. The products of the process,
lipid hydroperoxides, change the properties of membranes, act
as oxidants or can be converted (Schneider 
., 2001, 2004;
α
Sun & Salomon, 2004) to a variety of 
-unsaturated aldehydes
of  which  4-hydroxynon-2-enal  (4-HNE)  is  the  most  abundant

and prototypical example. At physiological concentrations,
4-HNE  is  a  signaling  molecule  which  modulates  a  variety  of
fundamental  biological  processes  (reviewed  by  Petersen  &
Doorn,  2004).  The  compound  becomes  toxic  at  higher  levels
owing to its electrophilic character (Esterbauer 
., 1991). It
forms  Michael  adducts  with  nucleophilic  centers  on  proteins
and  nucleic  acids  (Petersen  &  Doorn,  2004),  can  cross-link
proteins and contributes to the formation of lipofuscin (Xu &
Sayre, 1998; Xu 

., 2000), among other properties.

et al

et al

The metabolism of 4-HNE can be oxidative (oxidation of the
aldehyde  function  to  a  carboxylic  acid),  reductive  (reduction
of the aldehyde function, or reduction of the double bond in
position  2)  or  conjugative  (Michael  adduct  formation  with
glutathione) (reviewed by Petersen & Doorn, 2004). Conjugation
with glutathione is probably the predominant pathway in most
tissues  (Petersen  &  Doorn,  2004)  and,  although  catalysed  by
most glutathione transferases (GSTs), it is most efficiently carried
out  by  specialized  enzymes  of  this  superfamily  exemplified
by the murine mGSTA4-4 (Zimniak 
., 1994). We have also
identified  GSTs  capable  of  efficient  conjugation  of  4-HNE  in
et al
invertebrates (Singh 
., 2003), including
Caenorhabditis  elegans
.,  2001).  The  mammalian
enzymes with high catalytic efficiency for 4-HNE belong to the
Drosophila melanogaster
Alpha class of GSTs, whereas those in 
are classified as Sigma and Delta, and the nematode GST is of
the Pi class (Engle 
., 2001). The emergence of this activity in
evolutionarily distant GST classes indicates convergent evolution
(Sawicki 
.,  2003).  This,  together  with  the  wide  species
distribution, suggests an important physiological role for 4-HNE
conjugation, perhaps common to all aerobic organisms.

., 2001; Sawicki 
  (Engle 

et al

et al

The  chain  reaction  character  of  lipid  peroxidation  and  the
ensuing  amplification  of  the  initiating  oxidative  stimulus  raise
the  intriguing  question  of  whether  this  mechanism  could
contribute to organismal aging, as would be predicted from the
free radical theory of the aging process (Harman, 1956). If the
answer is yes, two aspects of the process may be biologically
relevant. One is the above-mentioned increase in the number of
potentially damaging molecules, inherent in the chain reaction,
which could overwhelm the existing defense mechanisms. The
other aspect is a shift in the chemical characteristics of the insult:
an oxidative or radical-mediated stress would be converted into
4-HNE-mediated electrophilic stress. 4-HNE is relatively selective
for  nucleophilic  centers,  especially  soft  nucleophiles  such  as
those present in proteins, whereas the most damaging ROS, the
hydroxyl radical, is very short-lived and is thus non-selective.
Formation of 4-HNE adducts frequently alters the function of
proteins, and many known regulatory proteins are targets of 4-
HNE modification (Dianzani, 2003; Forman 
., 2003; Petersen
& Doorn, 2004). It is therefore conceivable that 4-HNE, although
sharing with ROS the ability to inactivate cellular components
stochastically, has an additional, perhaps more insidious effect.
4-HNE could modify key regulatory proteins and alter signaling
cascades  (Leonarduzzi 
.,  2004)  or  inappropriately  realign
metabolism. This could cause cell loss or tissue dysfunction more
effectively than accumulation of random damage.

et al

et al

C. elegans

Here we provide evidence in support of the hypothesis that
electrophilic stress is indeed a contributor to aging in the model
organism 
. Mitigation of 4-HNE-mediated electrophilic
damage by overexpression of 4-HNE-metabolizing enzymes led
to  an  extension  of  both  median  and  maximal  lifespan  of  the
nematode. This finding contributes to a better understanding
of the molecular basis of the aging process and its relationship
to stress resistance.

Results

Isolation and characterization of CeGSTP2-2

C. elegans

A GST with glutathione-conjugating activity for 4-HNE was
isolated from 
 by a combination of glutathione (GSH)-
et al
affinity  chromatography  and  isoelectric  focusing  (Engle 
.,
2001). The major N-terminal sequence of the protein obtained by
Edman microsequencing matched a single conceptually trans-
lated protein among the 44 GSTs and seven GST-like sequences
listed in release WS135 of WormBase (www.wormbase.org).
The protein, denoted as the 
 gene product in WormBase,
was identified as a Pi-class GST on the basis of conserved amino
acid residues and an analysis of intron–exon boundaries (Engle
et al
 gene product) has
been previously assigned to the Pi class (Weston 
., 1989),
we propose the name CeGSTP2-2 for the 
 gene product,
according to the convention developed for GST nomenclature
(Mannervik 

., 2001). Because another GST (the

The kinetic parameters of CeGSTP2-2 with 4-HNE as substrate
are listed in Table 1. The catalytic efficiency of CeGSTP2-2 toward
this  electrophilic  lipid  peroxidation  product  is  approximately
three-fold  lower  than  that  of  a  mammalian  Alpha-class  GST,
mGSTA4-4 (an enzyme highly specialized for 4-HNE metabolism;
see  Zimniak 
.,  1994).  However,  the  catalytic  efficiency  of
CeGSTP2-2  for  4-HNE  is  similar  to  that  of  other  invertebrate
GSTs  that  carry  out  this  reaction  (Singh 
.,  2001;  Sawicki
et al
.,  2003).  CeGSTP2-2  has  low  activity  with  acrolein  but  is
relatively efficient in catalysing the conjugation of 
-non-2-
enal (Table 1). For comparison, we measured the corresponding
activities of the 
 gene product, also denoted as
GST-p24 (Leiers, 2002; Leiers 
., 2003) (Table 1). The specific
activity  with 
-non-2-enal  was  almost  two  orders  of
magnitude  higher  for  CeGSTP2-2  than  for  the 
  gene
product (Table 1). For unknown reasons, however, in our hands
the  activities  of  the 
  gene  product  for  several  substrates
were significantly lower (Table 1) than previously reported (Leiers,
2002; Leiers

quantitatively, attesting to a high binding affinity and capacity of
GSH-agarose for the enzyme. This indicates that CeGSTP2-2

lysates  were  treated  with  the  antibody,  and  the  immune
complexes were recovered using bead-bound secondary antibody
and  separated  by  SDS-PAGE.  Mass  spectrometric  analysis  of
tryptic peptides derived from a broad band migrating at approx-
imately  25 kDa  revealed  the  expected  presence  of  IgY  light
chain, and of the following peptides: LLFLDNGIK, AVPQLYYFTIR
and VDGQEIVQTGAIMR. The three peptides give 16% sequence
coverage and a Mascot score (see Experimental procedures) of
104. Each of the three peptides yields a perfect match to two
C. elegans
 proteins: CeGSTP2-2 and predicted protein F56A4.3.
The latter is a 105-amino-acid protein with a calculated mole-
cular weight of 12.2 kDa. Its existence is confirmed by the pres-
ence of an expressed sequence tag (yk773h08.5 in WormBase).
CeGSTP2-2 and F56A4.3 share the sequence of 78 N-terminal
amino acids, which include the three peptides listed above. The
antibody may thus recognize F56A4.3 in addition to CeGSTP2-
C. elegans
2, and the 13-kDa band observed on Western blots of 
lysates  (Fig. 1)  could  represent  F56A4.3.  Possible  functions  of
F56A4.3 were not investigated. However, a protein that corre-
sponds only to the N-terminal domain of a typical GST would
not  be  expected  to  have  GST  activity  as  it  would  lack  the
electrophile binding site (Armstrong, 1997). This, together with
the  lack  of  other  GSTs  detectable  by  mass  spectrometry
sequencing, indicates that the antibody is specific for a single
functional 

 GST, CeGSTP2-2.

various amounts of pre-immune (䊊) and anti-CeGSTP2-2 (䊉) chicken IgY,

product  has  activity  toward  trans-non-2-enal  (Leiers  et al.,
2003), and we found that this enzyme also conjugates 4-HNE,
albeit with an almost five-fold lower activity than CeGSTP2-2
(Table 1).  To  estimate  what  fraction  of  the  worm’s  4-HNE-
conjugating activity is due to CeGSTP2-2, C. elegans lysates were
immunodepleted with anti-CeGSTP2-2 antibody. As shown in
Fig. 2, approximately 20–25% of the 4-HNE-conjugating activity
could  be  depleted  by  immune  IgY  raised  against  bacterially
expressed, purified CeGSTP2-2, but not by pre-immune IgY. This
result is in reasonable agreement with the fraction of activity
that  binds  to  a  GSH  affinity  column,  and  indicates  that  the
balance  of  4-HNE-conjugating  activity  can  be  attributed  to
GST(s) which immunologically do not cross-react with CeGSTP2-
2,  and  which  probably  belong  to  a  class  that  fails  to  bind
effectively to GSH-agarose.

Expression of CeGSTP2-2 and mGSTA4-4 transgenes

Western  blot  analysis  demonstrated  the  absence  in  pha-1
control worms of material immunologically cross-reactive with
mGSTA4-4. By contrast, mGSTA4-4 was expressed at similar
levels in several independent mGsta4 transgenic lines (Fig. 3A).
CeGSTP2-2 was detectable by Western blotting in pha-1 worms,
but  was  present  at  higher  levels  in  gst-10  transgenic  animals
(Fig. 3B). Quantitation of CeGSTP2-2 levels has shown that, in
the five transgenic lines represented in Fig. 3(B), the protein was
overexpressed by a factor of 2.4 ± 0.6 relative to control worms.

The expression or overexpression of mGSTA4-4 and CeGSTP2-2,

was eluted with GSH (Simons & Vander Jagt, 1977), and half of the eluate 
(i.e. GSTs isolated from 1 mg lysate protein) was loaded on the gel (SDS−

pha-1 controls (Table 2). The specific activity increased by 21%
and 36% in mGsta4 and gst-10 transgenic animals, respectively.
The increase was statistically significant in both cases (Table 2).
The 36% increase in specific activity in gst-10 transgenic worms
is consistent with the 2.4-fold increase in CeGSTP2-2 protein,
given the fact that this enzyme accounts for approximately one-
quarter to one-third of the total 4-HNE-conjugating activity (see
Discussion).

ments were completed, the tissue distribution of GFP expressed
under  control  of  the  gst-10  promoter,  reported  in  an  online
database (R. Johnsen et al., British Columbia C. elegans Gene
Expression Consortium, funded by Genome Canada and Genome
British  Columbia  and  accessible  at  www.wormbase.org),
included head neurons among the expression sites. In the latter
experiments, GFP was expressed under the control of a 2.9-kb
promoter fragment, the 3′ end of which abuts the translation
start codon of gst-10.

An expression pattern similar to that of the reporter protein
GFP was also obtained by indirect immunostaining of wild-type
or  gst-10  transgenic  worms  with  anti-CeGSTP2-2  antibody
(Fig. 5C,D,  respectively),  as  well  as  mGsta4  transgenic  worms
with anti-mGSTA4-4 antibody (Fig. 5E). Both transgenes were
driven by a fragment of the gst-10 promoter (see Experimental
procedures). These results cross-verify the methods used, and
confirm the selectivity of the gst-10 promoter for a relatively small
subset of cells, which probably includes head and tail neurons.

Stress resistance of GST-expressing transgenic animals

C. elegans expressing either the gst-10 or the mGsta4 transgene
had an increased resistance to hydrogen peroxide, paraquat, heat
shock and ultraviolet (UV) irradiation at 254 nm as compared
with pha-1 controls (Fig. 6). The increase in stress resistance was
relatively small, typically 10–30% gain in median survival time,
but was robust across independent transgenic lines (Fig. 6) and
between  experiments;  and  was  statistically  significant,  except
for H2O2 treatment of animals expressing mGSTA4-4 for which
significance was marginal (Fig. 6A). With the exception of heat
shock  (Fig. 6E,F),  the  increase  in  stress  resistance  was  more
pronounced in gst-10 than in mGsta4 transgenic animals. This
differential effect on stress resistance correlates with a greater
conjugating activity for 4-HNE and lower level of 4-HNE-protein
adducts in gst-10 as compared with mGsta4 transgenic animals
(Table 2 and Fig. 4, respectively).

Longevity of GST-expressing transgenic animals

The  lifespan  of  C. elegans  was  extended  by  expression  of
mGSTA4-4  as  well  as  by  overexpression  of  the  endogenous
CeGSTP2-2  (Figs 7 and 8). The median lifespan of pha-1 control
worms was 10.8 days at 25.5 °C, and was extended by 13% and

CeGSTP2-2,  respectively  (Table 3).  Survival  curves  conformed
approximately to the Gompertz function (r 2 = 0.993, 0.984 and
0.992 for pha-1, mGsta4 and gst-10, respectively). The Gompertz
parameters are listed in Table 3. Lifespan extension was statis-
tically highly significant for both types of transgenic animals vs.
controls,  and  gst-10  worms  were  longer-lived  than  mGsta4
worms at marginal statistical significance (see legend to Fig. 7
for further details).

In addition to the experimental data shown in Fig. 7, in which
all three genotypes (pha-1 control and the gst-10 and mGsta4
transgenic strains) were compared side by side, survival of the

were determined in pha-1 controls and in mGsta4 and gst-10 transgenic 
worms by ELISA (see Experimental procedures) in six separate experiments. 
Each individual experiment is denoted by a different plotting symbol, and 
measurements for the three genotypes obtained within each experiment are 
connected. The three groups are positioned on the abscissa according to their 
average 4-HNE-conjugating activity taken from Table 2. After adjusting for 
variability between experiments by General Linear Model ANOVA or by multiple 
regression, the amount of 4-HNE adducts was found to be unequal for the 
three groups of worms (P = 0.0006). Multiple comparisons with Tukey–
Kramer correction have further shown that pha-1 differs in the level of 4-
HNE adducts from both mGsta4 (P = 0.013) and gst-10 (P = 0.0006), but that 
the difference between mGsta4 and gst-10 does not reach statistical 
significance (P = 0.15).

Level of 4-HNE-protein adducts in gst-10 and mgsta4 
transgenic worms

The  level  of  4-HNE  adducts  varied  considerably  between
individual measurements (Fig. 4). However, after adjusting for
interexperimental variability, the level of 4-HNE-protein adducts
was significantly higher in pha-1 controls than in either of the
transgenic  lines.  Moreover,  the  4-HNE-conjugating  activity  in
pha-1, mGsta4 and gst-10 worms inversely correlated with the
amount of accumulated 4-HNE-protein adducts in these animals
(Fig. 4).  This  correlation  demonstrates  that  the  overexpressed
enzymes  are  functional  in  situ,  and  is  consistent  with  the
expected biochemical function of both enzymes in limiting 4-
HNE-mediated  electrophilic  modifications  and  presumably
damage to cellular proteins.

Localization of CeGSTP2-2

Transgenic worms were generated which express green fluores-
cent protein (GFP) under the control of the autologous gst-10
promoter. A punctate distribution of the reporter protein was
observed that was most prominent in a small set of cells at the
mouth and in the head (adjacent to the pharyngeal bulbs) of
the  worm;  intense  fluorescence  was  also  observed  at  the  tail
(Fig. 5).  Two  promoter  fragments,  3.2  and  2.4 kb  in  length,
yielded an identical pattern of GFP expression. After these experi-

Maximum likelihood estimates of Gompertz parameters (listed with their lower and upper 95% confidence

line with its derived congenic lines represents a set of naturally
occurring polymorphic variants of genes within a region ranging

Discussion
C. elegans  has  the  ability  to  synthesize  ω-6  polyunsaturated
acids including arachidonic and linoleic acids (Watts & Browse,

2002), which are the biological precursors of 4-HNE (Esterbauer
et al., 1991). In the present work, we have shown the existence
of protein−4-HNE adducts (Fig. 4), thus demonstrating directly
that 4-HNE is indeed formed in C. elegans. The manifold and
complex physiological effects of 4-HNE (Dianzani et al., 1999;
Nakashima et al., 2003; Carini et al., 2004; Petersen & Doorn,
2004) and the toxicity of the compound at high levels (Esterbauer
et al., 1991) imply the existence of pathways to metabolize 4-
HNE, both for signal termination and for detoxification. Indeed, we
have previously identified a glutathione transferase in C. elegans,
for which we propose the name CeGSTP2-2 for reasons outlined
in the Results section, which is able to catalyse glutathione
conjugation  of  4-HNE  (Engle  et al.,  2001).  We  now  present
evidence that this GST accounts for one-quarter to one-third of

could play a significant role in the physiology of these cells and
in their protection from oxidative or electrophilic damage.

To  investigate  the  biological  role  of  4-HNE-conjugating
activity  in  C. elegans,  and  specifically  in  the  cells  that  express
CeGSTP2-2,  we  created  transgenic  lines  in  which  either  the
overexpression of the autologous CeGSTP2-2 or heterologous
expression of murine mGSTA4-4, an enzyme with particularly
high catalytic efficiency for 4-HNE, was driven by the autologous
gst-10 promoter. We have verified, both by the use of the GFP
reporter protein and by detection of the two transgenic GSTs
through indirect immunofluorescence, that the length of the 5′
flanking fragments of the gst-10 gene used in the transgenic
constructs  was  sufficient  to  ensure  cell-specific  transgene
expression indistinguishable from that of the native gene. Thus,
mGSTA4-4 and the additional CeGSTP2-2 in mGsta4 and gst-10
transgenic lines, respectively, retained the expression pattern
of autologous CeGSTP2-2. It should be noted that all transgenes
used herein were extrachromosomal episomes, so that variation
in  expression  between  worms  could  be  attributed  to  somatic
segregation of the transgene.

As described in the Results section, the anti-CeGSTP2-2 anti-
body used in the present work is likely to recognize, in addition
to  CeGSTP2-2  itself,  the  C. elegans  protein  F56A4.3,  which
consists  of  the  N-terminal  domain  of  CeGSTP2-2  fused  to  a
short C-terminal peptide of 27 amino acids. The functions and
expression pattern of this protein are unknown. However, the
genomic sequences of gst-10 and f56a4.3 are identical for more
than 25 kb upstream of their respective translation start codons,
as  determined  by  alignment  of  sequences  deposited  in
WormBase, implying that f56a4.3 arose by a partial duplication
of the gst-10 gene. As we verified that a 5′ flanking region of
gst-10 much shorter than 25 kb is sufficient to restrict transgene

activity: it is lowest in gst-10 worms, intermediate in mGsta4
transgenics and highest in pha-1 controls (Fig. 4).

It is noteworthy that the amount of 4-HNE–protein adducts
decreased  almost  two-fold  in  gst-10  transgenic  vs.  control
C. elegans in each of the individual measurements (Fig. 4), even
though the absolute levels of the adducts were quite variable,
perhaps due to uncontrolled day-to-day differences in unavoid-
able environmental stresses. This stands in sharp contrast to the
limited number of cells in which CeGSTP2-2 was detected (Fig. 5
and the British Columbia C. elegans Gene Expression Consortium;
see Results). Several possibilities could be invoked to reconcile
the low percentage of cells expressing CeGSTP2-2 with the large
effect  of  CeGSTP2-2  overexpression  on  whole-body  4-HNE–
protein adducts. For example, a significant proportion of all 4-
HNE-modified proteins could be present in the few neurons that
express CeGSTP2-2, or the enzyme could be expressed below
the  detection  threshold  by  cells  other  than  the  putatively
identified neurons. Alternatively, cells expressing CeGSTP2-2, even
if low in number, could constitute a ‘sink’ for 4-HNE diffusing
from surrounding cells.

The  biochemical  parameters  discussed  so  far  indicate  that
the three groups of C. elegans lines used in this work, namely
pha-1  controls,  mGsta4  transgenics  and  gst-10  transgenics,
constitute  a  graded  series  with  progressively  greater  4-HNE-
conjugating activity and gradually decreasing steady-state level
of 4-HNE-mediated electrophilic damage. Although free 4-HNE
was  not  measured,  4-HNE–protein  adducts  are  thought  to
reflect levels of 4-HNE integrated over time (but limited by the
average half-life of the modified proteins).

Although the extrachromosomal maintenance of transgenes
in C. elegans eliminates genetic positional effects, the level of
transgene expression may still vary between individual sublines.
Therefore, two independent pha-1 controls, five independent
mGsta4 transgenic lines and five independent gst-10 transgenic
lines  were  generated.  Within  each  group,  the  lines  behaved
similarly in all experiments that were conducted. The availability of
a graded series of three groups of lines differing in 4-HNE levels
(pha-1 control, and mGsta4 and gst-10 transgenics) permitted
a more conclusive evaluation of the physiological role of 4-HNE
than would be possible in the more usual binary situation (i.e.
control vs. transgenic strain). Indeed, with only one exception
(heat shock), the stress resistances correlated with the 4-HNE-
conjugating activity of the animals (Fig. 6). Similarly, the median
lifespans ranked in the same order as 4-HNE-conjugating activity,
i.e. pha-1 control < mGsta4 < gst-10 transgenic worms (Fig. 7
and Table 3). Thus, experimental manipulations which alter the
ability of the organism to metabolize 4-HNE affect stress resist-
ance and lifespan in a dose-dependent manner. The autologous
CeGSTP2-2 and the heterologous murine mGSTA4-4 appeared
to exert the same effect, differentiated only by their respective
activities. This indicates that lifespan and stress resistance are
influenced by 4-HNE rather than by other potential consequences
of GST overexpression such as direct protein–protein interactions.
Such regulatory interactions, which are independent of catalytic
activity, have been described for GSTs (Adler et al., 1999; Dorion

Fig. 9 Correlation between median lifespan and 4-HNE-conjugating activity 
in two series of C. elegans congenic lines. Two sets of congenic lines differing 
in stress resistance and longevity were selected as previously described 
(Ayyadevara et al., 2001, 2003). Specific activity of 4-HNE conjugation was 
measured in worm lysates as described in the Experimental procedures. Lines 
SR704 and SR708 were constructed in a CL2a strain background, whereas 
SR101 and SR102 have an RC301genetic background.

expression to the native localization of CeGSTP2-2, we conclude
that F56A4.3 and CeGSTP2-2 should be expressed in the same
cells. Thus, F56A4.3 is unlikely to be a confounding factor in
the immunolocalization experiments.

The overexpression of CeGSTP2-2 in gst-10 animals was 2.4 ±
0.6-fold greater than in controls (see Results). From this factor and
from the estimate, based on retention on GSH columns and on
immunodepletion, that CeGSTP2-2 accounts for 25–33% of 4-
HNE-conjugating activity in wild-type worms, it can be calculated
that  the  gst-10  transgenic  animals  should  have  a  4-HNE-
−1,
conjugating activity in the range of 0.26–0.36 µmol mg
in  good  agreement  with  the  experimental  value  of  0.295 ±
−1 (Table 2). This indicates that the over-
0.043 µmol mg
expressed CeGSTP2-2 is enzymatically fully active. Interestingly,
lysates of mGsta4 transgenic worms have a 4-HNE-conjugating
activity which is similar to, or perhaps slightly lower than, that of
gst-10 transgenic animals (Table 2), in spite of a catalytic efficiency
of  mGSTA4-4  that  is  30-fold  higher  than  that  of  CeGSTP2-2
(Table 1). This suggests that the heterologous mGSTA4-4 protein
may be poorly expressed or rapidly degraded in C. elegans. In
fact, CeGSTP2-2 was readily detected in 25 µg of crude lysate
from wild-type or transgenic animals, whereas 40 times more
protein  (i.e.  an  enriched  GST  fraction  equivalent  to  1 mg  of
lysate) was necessary to visualize mGSTA4-4 on Western blots
of mGsta4 transgenic worms (Fig. 3), even though the sensitivity
of the two anti-GST antibodies for detection of their respective
antigens is similar (data not shown). This result is consistent with
a  lower  steady-state  expression  level  of  the  murine  GST  as
compared with the autologous CeGSTP2-2. The resulting smaller
increment in enzyme activity in mGsta4 as compared with gst-
10  transgenics  is  also  reflected  in  the  level  of  4-HNE–protein
adducts, which is inversely proportional to the 4-HNE-conjugating

et al.,  2002;  Ryoo  et al.,  2004),  including  C. elegans  GSTs
(Greetham et al., 2004), but are unlikely for a murine GST in
the context of a C. elegans cell.

Evidence  obtained  by  perturbing  the  system  (expression  of
GST transgenes) and measuring the outcome establishes a cause–
effect  relationship  between  4-HNE  metabolism  and  lifespan,
although neither the underlying mechanism nor the number of
steps between cause and effect can be derived from the data.
The conclusion that there is a cause–effect relationship between
the overexpression of some but not all (see next paragraph) GSTs
and lifespan is corroborated by independent correlative evidence.
We have demonstrated that lifespan positively correlates with 4-
HNE-conjugating activity in a series of congenic lines of C. elegans
(Fig. 9).  In  these  lines,  DNA  regions  0.3–5 Mb  in  length  are
replaced by the corresponding regions from worms of a distinct
genetic background. Regions of such length cover approximately
30–500 genes, out of the estimated 17 500 genes in C. elegans.
The  regions  that  have  been  identified  as  relevant  to  lifespan
(Ayyadevara  et al.,  2001,  2003)  may  include  the  gst-10  locus
(located on chromosome V, physical map position 2 561 521–
2 564 525 bp, genetic map position −13.68 cM). However, at
least  part  of  the  observed  differences  in  4-HNE-conjugating
activity between the congenic lines could be due to changes
in GSTs other than CeGSTP2-2, to indirect effects on 4-HNE
conjugation by CeGSTP2-2 or to regulation of GST transcription
by trans-acting factors encoded by genes in the replaced regions.
Additional work will be needed to identify the gene(s) respon-
sible for modulation of 4-HNE-conjugating activity, and to test
directly their effects on lifespan.

In contrast to the effect observed by us for CeGSTP2-2 and
mGSTA4-4,  not  all  GSTs  extend  lifespan  of  C. elegans  when
overexpressed.  Strains  either  overexpressing  the  gst-4  gene
product or carrying a deletion of that gene did not differ in their
lifespans from the wild-type control (Leiers et al., 2003). The gst-
4 gene product has low activity for α,β-unsaturated aldehydes,
including 4-HNE (Table 1). Overall, our findings strongly suggest
that 4-HNE, or other similar α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds,
affect lifespan. The difference between the gst-4 gene product
and CeGSTP2-2 in the effect on lifespan could be due to disparate
substrate specificities or differences in tissue distribution.

Our finding that an increased capacity for 4-HNE metabolism
in a subset of cells (probably including neurons) extends lifespan
in C. elegans raises the broader question of a possible mechanism
underlying this effect, and its relationship to other known genetic
and metabolic factors which modulate aging. The best-studied
mechanism that controls lifespan is the insulin/insulin-like growth
factor-1 (IGF-1) signaling pathway (reviewed in Kenyon, 2001;
Warner, 2005). Mutations in that pathway can extend lifespan
several-fold, i.e. to a significantly greater extent than changes
in 4-HNE conjugation. Caloric restriction (Weindruch & Sohal,
1997) or mutations that reduce food intake or food utilization
(Lakowski  &  Hekimi,  1998;  Apfeld  &  Kenyon,  1999;  Rogina
et al., 2000) extend lifespan in a variety of organisms. Caloric
restriction  is  thought  to  shift  the  NAD+/NADH  ratio,  which  in
turn may regulate the histone/protein deacetylase of the Sir-2

family (Blander & Guarente, 2004). The IGF-1 and Sir-2 pathways
are interdependent, at least in mammalian cells (Nemoto et al.,
2004).  The  specific  target  proteins  whose  expression  and/or
activity are modulated by the two pathways are not fully known
but include stress-resistance gene products. Strikingly, neuronal
cells, some of which appear to express CeGSTP2-2, are of central
importance in the aging process, either as originators of IGF-1
and other signals (Wolkow, 2002; Alcedo & Kenyon, 2004), as
targets  of  pharmacological  or  genetic  interventions  (Evason
et al., 2005; this work), or as a ‘weak link’ which could determine
organismal aging (Parkes et al., 1998; Wolkow et al., 2000).

The aging process is often considered within the conceptual
framework of the free radical theory of aging (Harman, 1956,
2003)  or  its  variants.  Our  finding  that  products  of  lipid  per-
oxidation such as 4-HNE are relevant to aging fits within that
framework.  In  particular,  our  results  corroborate  the  recently
proposed ‘green theory of aging’ (McElwee et al., 2004; Gems
& McElwee, 2005). According to this theory, initiating events,
including  but  not  limited  to  ROS  and  encompassing  a  variety
of  stochastic  perturbations,  lead  to  the  formation  of  a  wide
spectrum of secondary deleterious and toxic metabolites which
are  the  actual  biochemical  effectors  of  damage.  The  damage
accumulates and eventually becomes manifest as aging. In this
view, the aging process would be retarded most effectively by
detoxification reactions (hence ‘green’, by analogy with environ-
mental concerns for clean waste disposal). The significance
of pathways such as IGF-1 signaling would lie in their roles in
regulating  a  wide  range  of  detoxification  enzymes.  GSTs
constitute a subset of these enzymes, explaining why the effect
of CeGSTP2-2 on lifespan, although robust, is smaller than that
of changes in the IGF-1 pathway. If correct, the above hypothesis
predicts that CeGSTP2-2 should be overexpressed in long-lived
C. elegans strains carrying hypomorphic mutations of daf-2 (which
encodes an insulin/IGF-1 receptor), and that lifespan extension
in  such  strains  should  be  partially  but  not  fully  reversed  by
abrogating CeGSTP2-2 expression. Work is in progress in our
laboratories to test these hypotheses; preliminary data indicate
that the predictions are indeed correct.

Determination of C. elegans lifespan

Worms were grown for two generations without depletion of
bacteria, and were harvested by rinsing with S buffer (0.1 M NaCl,
0.05 M potassium phosphate, pH 6.0) (Brenner, 1974) into 15-
mL plastic Falcon tubes. Adults were allowed to settle, and eggs
were recovered from hermaphrodites by alkaline hypochlorite
lysis (5 min at room temperature in 0.5 N NaOH, 1.05% hypo-
chlorite) (Emmons et al., 1979). The eggs were rinsed with S buffer
and transferred to fresh agar plates containing E. coli OP50. Survival
cultures (in 60-mm dishes) were set up 1 day after the L4/adult
molt and were incubated at 25.5 °C. Worms were counted and
transferred  daily  to  fresh  60-mm  plates  seeded  with  E. coli
OP50. Worms were considered dead when they failed to move,
either spontaneously or in response to touch, and showed no
pharyngeal pumping. Worms that crawled away from the plate
were censored (considered to have escaped). The time of death
or escape was assumed to be at the midpoint of the interval
between the time the worm was found dead or missing, respect-
ively, and the time of the preceding observation. Between 100
and 150 worms per strain were used in each lifespan experiment.

Determination of stress resistance

To  assess  resistance  to  H2O2,  age-synchronized  worms  were
grown  in  liquid  culture  at  25.5 °C.  Fifty  adult  worms  (day  4
post-hatch) were added to each 35-mm dish containing 3 mL
−1), E. coli OP50
S buffer supplemented with cholesterol (5 µg mL
−1), and freshly added H2O2 (5 mM). The total
(2 × 109 cells mL
number of live worms in each dish was counted at regular time
intervals. Worms that did not swim and showed no pharyngeal
pumping were considered dead. Paraquat resistance was deter-
mined by transferring 4-day-old adult worms to plates containing
150 mM paraquat, and scoring as described for lifespan deter-
mination. For assessing heat resistance, young adult worms were
incubated in 60-mm plates at 36 ± 0.4 °C, and were scored every
2 h for motility, provoked movement and pharyngeal pumping,
as described for lifespan determination. Resistance to UV radiation
(254 nm) was measured by placing 50 adult (4 days post-hatch)
hermaphrodites on NGM agar plates (without E. coli ) and deliv-
−2 in a UV Stratalinker 1800
ering an irradiation dose of 5000 J m
(Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA), followed by transfer to NGM
plates with E. coli and incubation at 25.5 °C. Worms were scored
as dead or censored as described for lifespan measurements.

Microinjection

Germline transformation was carried out using C. elegans LGIII,
pha-1 (e2123) mutants. The pha-1/pBX system (a kind gift from
R. Schnabel, Braunschweig, Germany) is based on the temperature-
sensitive embryonic lethal mutation pha-1. Constructs carrying

Gfp, gst-10 or mGsta4 transgenes under the control of the gst-
−1 and were
10 promoter (see below) were adjusted to 80 µg mL
microinjected into the distal arm of the hermaphrodite gonad
as previously described (Mello et al., 1991). The pBX plasmid that
contained a wild-type copy of the pha-1 gene was co-injected with
the fusion constructs (Granato et al., 1994; Mello & Fire, 1995). Fol-
lowing microinjection, the animals were raised to 25 °C. Embry-
onal lethality caused by the pha-1 mutation is complemented in
transgenic animals carrying the pBX plasmid. Thus, transgenic
animals can be selected by shifting the F1 larvae of injected her-
maphrodites from 15 to 25 °C. Only transformed progeny survive
this selection and can be maintained by cultivation at 25 °C. For
each construct, visible phenotypes of multiple animals from at
least three independent lines were examined using Nomarski optics.

Isolation of 4-HNE-conjugating GST from C. elegans

The Bristol-N2 strain of C. elegans was grown in liquid culture,
−1).  Worms  were
in  NGM  containing  E. coli  OP50  (2 × 109  mL
collected and stored at −70 °C until use. For purification of 4-HNE-
metabolizing GSTs, 5 g of frozen C. elegans pellet was ground
in a mortar on dry ice. The frozen powder was transferred to a
glass-Teflon homogenizer containing 35 mL of 20 mM potassium
phosphate,  pH 7.0,  1.4 mM  2-mercaptoethanol  (buffer  A)
supplemented  with  1 mM  PMSF.  Following  homogenization
for 5 min, the lysate was sonicated for 2 min (power setting 3)
using  a  Branson  Sonifier  450  (VWR,  West  Chester,  PA,  USA)
equipped with a tapered microtip, 3 mm in diameter, and was
centrifuged  for  15 min  at  25 000 g.  The  supernatant  was
dialysed for 4 h against buffer A, and was used for isolation of
a GST fraction by GSH affinity chromatography according to
the method of Simons & Vander Jagt (1977). The GST pool was
further  fractionated  by  isoelectric  focusing  as  described  in
Ahmad  et al.  (1988).  Fractions  from  isoelectric  focusing  were
assayed  for  GST  activity  with  both  4-HNE  and  1-chloro-2,4-
dinitrobenzene as substrates (Engle et al., 2001).

Cloning, bacterial expression and enzymatic 
characterization of CeGSTP2-2

The coding sequence of gst-10 was amplified from total C. elegans
cDNA using the sense primer 5′-AGAGCTCGTCATATGGCCGT-
the  antisense  primer  5′-
GCCACAACTTTACTAC  and 
TCATTTGCATTTATTCCATGGTCAGTTCATTCCCTTCTCAATC.
The  primers  were  modified  (underlined)  to  create  an  NdeI
restriction site that includes the initiation codon, and an NcoI
site  immediately  downstream  of  the  translation  termination
codon,  in  the  sense  and  antisense  primers,  respectively.  The
amplification product was digested with NdeI and NcoI, and was
subcloned  between  the  same  sites  of  the  pET-30a(+)  vector
(Novagen,  Madison,  WI,  USA).  E. coli  BL21(DE3)pLysS  was
transformed  with  the  expression  vector,  and  the  CeGSTP2-2
protein was expressed upon induction with 1 mM isopropyl-β-
D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTC) and purified by GSH affinity
chromatography (Simons & Vander Jagt, 1977).

Cloning, bacterial expression and enzymatic 
characterization of the gst-4 gene product

The coding sequence of gst-4 was amplified from total C. elegans
cDNA  using  the  sense  primer  5′-AGCCATATGCCAAAC-
TATAAGCTATTG and the antisense primer 5′-AGCGGATCCT-
TAAACAATACTATCCTTTCTTG (the introduced NdeI and BamHI
sites, respectively, are underlined). The amplification product was
digested with NdeI and BamHI, and was subcloned between
the same sites of the pET-19b vector (Novagen). This added an
(His)10 tag to the N-terminus of the GST. The entire open reading
frame  was  sequenced  and  was  found  to  be  identical  to  the
gst-4 sequence reported previously (Leiers, 2002), and to that
deposited in WormBase. The protein was expressed in E. coli BL21
Star (DE3)pLysS (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) after induction
with  1 mM  IPTG,  and  was  purified  either  by  Ni2+  chelation
chromatography utilizing the added His tag (Leiers et al., 2003),
or  by  glutathione  affinity  chromatography  (Simons  &  Vander
Jagt,  1977).  The  two  preparations  had  very  similar  enzymatic
properties with 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, 4-HNE, trans-non-
2-enal and cumene hydroperoxide as substrates (Table 1).

Enzyme activity assays

Catalytic activity with 4-HNE as substrate was measured accord-
ing to Alin et al. (1985). For determination of kinetic parameters
for 4-HNE, the concentration of the aldehyde was varied at a
constant GSH concentration (0.5 mM), and the kinetic parameters
were  obtained  from  non-linear  fitting  of  a  Michaelis–Menten
hyperbola  to  the  data.  Catalytic  activities  with  trans-non-2-
enal and acrolein were determined according to Pal et al. (2000)
and  Nilsson  et al.  (2000),  respectively,  and  activity  with  1-
chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene  was  measured  according  to  Habig
et al.  (1974).  Glutathione  peroxidase  activity  with  cumene
hydroperoxide  as  substrate  was  determined  as  described  by
Awasthi et al. (1975).

Generation of polyclonal antibodies against 
CeGSTP2-2

An  antibody  against  affinity-purified  bacterially  expressed
CeGSTP2-2 was raised in chicken commercially (Aves Laborat-
ories, Tigard, OR, USA). The IgY fraction was obtained from
egg  yolks  by  Aves  Laboratories  using  a  proprietary  protocol
involving solvent extraction and salt fractionation. Pre-immune
IgY was isolated from eggs of the same chicken collected prior
to antigen injection.

Western blot analysis

Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto
nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, NH, USA).
The  membrane  was  blocked  and  incubated  with  the  primary
antibody against mGSTA4-4 (Zimniak et al., 1994) or CeGSTP2-
2 at a 1 : 20 000 dilution at 4 °C overnight, then incubated with

the secondary antibody (peroxidase-coupled anti-IgY; Sigma, St
Louis, MO, USA) at 1 : 10 000 dilution at room temperature for
1 h,  followed  by  chemiluminescence  detection  using  the  ECL
Plus kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA) on a Storm
860 phosphoimager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).
Signal quantitation was carried out with the ImageQuant soft-
ware (Molecular Dynamics).

Immunodepletion of CeGSTP2-2 in worm lysates
Bristol-N2 worms were grown in liquid culture at 20 °C, were
harvested,  and  a  lysate  was  then  prepared.  Worm  lysate
(300 µg)  was  incubated  in  a  total  volume  of  0.5 mL  of
immunoprecipitation  buffer  [0.14 M  NaCl,  0.01 M  KCl,  8 mM
Na2HPO4,  2 mM  KH2PO4,  pH 7.4,  supplemented  with  Calbio-
chem protease inhibitor cocktail (La Jolla, CA, USA), set I, at 0.5×
strength]  with  varying  amounts  (up  to  1000 µg)  of  pre-
immune or anti-CeGSTP2-2 IgY overnight at 4 °C, followed by
an addition of agarose-coupled goat anti-chicken IgY (Aves
Laboratories) for 2 h at room temperature. The beads were pel-
leted, and the supernatant was analysed for 4-HNE-conjugating
activity.

Mass spectrometric analysis of proteins recognized by 
anti-CeGSTP2-2 antibody

C. elegans  lysate  was  obtained  as  described  in  the  previous
section  on  immunodepletion,  and  was  pre-adsorbed  with
agarose-coupled goat anti-chicken IgY antibody for 90 min at
room temperature to remove non-specifically reacting proteins.
The beads were pelleted by centrifugation and discarded, and
anti-CeGSTP2-2 antibody was added to the supernatant at a ratio
of 500 µg of IgY per 300 µg of lysate. The immunoprecipitate
was  recovered  using  fresh  goat  anti-chicken  IgY  antibody
coupled to agarose beads. The beads were washed seven times
with immunoprecipitation buffer, were extracted by heating with
SDS sample buffer, and the solubilized proteins were separated
on an SDS−12% polyacrylamide one-dimensional gel (Tris–glycine
system). The gel was stained overnight in SYPRO Ruby solution
(Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA). Gel images were acquired
using the ProPic imaging and spot-picking robot from Genomic
Solutions (Ann Arbor, MI, USA). A broad band migrating at 25–
29 kDa was excised into a 96-well plate with the ProPic, and
trypsin digestion was performed using the ProGest in-gel enzy-
matic  digestion  robot  from  Genomic  Solutions.  The  resulting
peptide mixture was separated by nanoflow capillary HPLC-MS/
MS using a CapLC XE pump (Waters Corp., Beverly, MA, USA)
−1 and equipped with a C18 (75 µm ×
operating at 200 nL min
15 cm) column. The eluate was analysed in-line by ESI-MS/MS
using a Micromass Q-Tof Micro (Waters) tandem mass spectro-
meter operating in the positive ion mode. Data acquisition was
performed  in  a  data-dependent  fashion.  The  resulting  data
were processed using ProteinLynx 2.1 (Waters), and the resulting
peak  list  was  submitted  for  database  searching  on  Mascot
(www.matrixscience.com).

Determination of 4-HNE–protein adducts by ELISA

The  level  of  4-HNE  adducts  on  proteins  was  measured  in
C. elegans lysates by competitive ELISA (Satoh et al., 1999) using
a  polyclonal  antibody  against  4-HNE-modified  keyhole  limpet
hemocyanin.  The  antibody  was  a  generous  gift  of  Dr  D.  R.
Petersen, University of Colorado, Denver.

Tissue specificity of CeGSTP2-2 expression as 
determined by a reporter gene

In order to investigate the cell-specific expression of CeGSTP2-2,
transgenic nematodes were created. The basic strategy involved
the insertion of fragments of the 5′ region of gst-10 into the
multicloning site of the vector pPD95.77 (provided by A. Fire,
Carnegie Institute, Baltimore). The inserted promoter sequence
drives the expression of the GFP reporter gene. The GFP coding
region is followed in the vector by translation termination and
poly(A) addition signals. The putative promoter region of gst-
10 was amplified by PCR using a proof-reading polymerase mix
(Expand  Long  Template  PCR  System,  Roche  Diagnostics,  Indi-
anapolis, IN, USA) with C. elegans genomic DNA as template.
Two  promoter  fragments  were  used.  For  both,  the  antisense
primer 5′-CGCGGATCCGAACAGAAGACGGATGTATTCTCCGAA
was used; the primer covers positions 89–115 downstream of the
translation start site in exon 2 of the gst-10 gene, and contains
an added BamH I restriction site (underlined). The sense primers
were 5′-CGCGGATCCTGTCATCATTTGTGTATATTACCTTTGTTC
and 5′-CGCGGATCCATTTCCTGACGAGAACCTATAGTATAAAAC,
located 3.1 and 2.3 kb, respectively, upstream of the translation
start  site  of  gst-10  (added  BamHI  sites  are  underlined).  For
microinjection (see above), the plasmid DNA was prepared using
the Endo Free Plasmid Maxi Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Both
promoter fragments yielded the same localization pattern of the
GFP reporter.

CeGSTP2-2 and mGSTA4-4 transgene expression 
in C. elegans

A  1.0-kb  putative  gst-10  promoter  fragment  comprising  the
intergenic sequence between gst-10 and the upstream adjacent
str-154  gene  was  amplified  using  the  Expand  Long  Template
PCR System (Roche Diagnostics). The sense primer 5′-AAAAC-
TGCAGTTTCCAAATGTGAAATTTAACCGGAGA was modified
(underlined) to insert a PstI restriction site. The antisense primer
5′-GGCACGGGGATCCTACGAGCTCTTATCGTTTA  was  used
to ablate the translation initiation codon of gst-10 by inserting
a BamHI restriction site (underlined). The PCR product (promoter
insert)  was  digested  with  PstI  and  BamHI  and  subcloned  into
the  pPD49.26  vector  (provided  by  A.  Fire)  digested  with  the
same restriction enzymes, yielding plasmid pPD49.26/CeP2pro.
The coding sequence of gst-10 was amplified from its cDNA
using  the  sense  primer  5′-TTAAGTTGAGCTAGCATGGCCGT-
GCCACAACTT  (NheI  restriction  site,  introduced  immediately
upstream of the translation initiation codon, is underlined) and

© Blackwell Publishing Ltd/Anatomical Society of Great Britain and Ireland 2005

the antisense primer 5′-TCATTTGCATTTATTCCATGGTCAGTTCA-
TTCCCTTCTCAATC  (NcoI  restriction  site,  added  immediately
downstream of the translation termination codon, is underlined).
Similarly, mGsta4 cDNA was amplified using the sense primer
5′-AGCCGTAACGCTAGCATGGCAGCCAAACCTAAG 
(NheI
restriction  site,  introduced  immediately  upstream  of  the
translation  initiation  codon,  is  underlined)  and  the  antisense
primer 5′-CTAGCATTGTCCATGGCTAGAACTTCAGGACAA (NcoI
restriction site, added immediately downstream of the trans-
lation termination codon, is underlined). For neither gene did
the introduction of the NheI site compromise the Kozak consensus
sequence for the translational start site as utilized in C. elegans.
The  two  amplification  products  were  digested  with  NheI  and
NcoI, and were subcloned between the same sites in pPD49.26/
CeP2pro. This yielded expression vectors pPD49.26/CeP2pro/gst-
10 and pPD49.26/CeP2pro/mGsta4, respectively, in which the
expression of each GST gene was placed under the control of
the gst-10 promoter. The two constructs were used for micro-
injection. Single F1 larvae were transferred to new agar plates and
the introduction of the expression vectors was confirmed in their
progeny by single-worm PCR according to Jansen et al. (1997).

Tissue specificity of CeGSTP2-2 expression as 
determined by indirect immunostaining

Cells  expressing  CeGSTP2-2  were  identified  by  staining  wild-
type adult C. elegans or worms overexpressing CeGSTP2-2 with
anti-CeGSTP2-2 antibody according to Finney & Ruvkun (1990).
Briefly, worms were fixed and permeabilized by freezing in 1%
buffered formaldehyde, thawing, and exposure to 1% Triton X-
100 and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, followed by 10 mM dithiothreitol.
After  washing,  the  worms  were  incubated  in  0.3%  H2O2  in
25 mM sodium borate, pH 9.2, washed, blocked consecutively
with  0.2%  bovine  serum  albumin  and  1%  goat  serum,  and
exposed to anti-CeGSTP2-2 antibodies (1 : 300 dilution) in the
presence of 2% bovine serum albumin and 0.5% Triton X-100.
The worms were washed, stained with an anti-chicken secondary
antibody labeled with Alexa 488 (1 : 200; Molecular Probes)
and photographed under a Nikon Eclipse E1000 fluorescence
microscope.  The  expression  pattern  of  mGSTA4-4  in  mGsta4
transgenic worms was determined as described above, except
that the primary antibody was anti-mGSTA4-4 raised in chicken
as described previously (Singh et al., 2002).

Statistics

Values  of  biochemical  parameters  were  compared  by  ANOVA
followed  by  pairwise  t-tests  with  a  correction  for  multiple
comparisons  (Tukey–Kramer).  Maximum  likelihood  estimates
of Gompertz survival parameters (Arking, 1998) and of median
lifespans were obtained using the program WinModest (Pletcher,
1999; Promislow et al., 1999). Survival curves were compared
by the log rank test and by randomization analysis (using 106
Monte Carlo samples). Data from multiple lifespan experiments,
each involving control and transgenic strains, were evaluated

270

in aggregate by Cox regression. The Bonferroni correction was
applied to multiple comparisons of lifespans. All statistical pro-
cedures were carried out in NCSS software (Number Cruncher
Statistical Systems, Kaysville, UT, USA).
