Abstract
Multicolor fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to
identify acquired chromosomal aberrations in 12 patients
with mycosis fungoides or Se´zary syndrome, the most com-
mon forms of primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL).
The most frequently affected chromosome was 12, which
showed clonal deletions or translocations with a break point
in 12q21 or 12q22 in five of seven consecutive Se´zary syn-
drome patients and a clonal monosomy in the sixth patient.
The break point of a balanced translocation t(12;18)(q21;q21.2),
mapped in the minimal common region of two deletions, fine
mapped to 12q2. By locus-specific FISH, the translocation
disrupted one gene, NAV3 (POMFIL1), a human homologue of
unc-53 in Caenorhabditis elegans. A missense mutation in the
remaining NAV3 allele was found in one of six cases with a
deletion or translocation. With locus-specific FISH, NAV3
deletions were found in the skin lesions of four of eight (50%)
patients with early mycosis fungoides (stages IA-IIA) and in
the skin or lymph node of 11 of 13 (85%) patients with ad-
vanced mycosis fungoides or Se´zary syndrome. Preliminary
functional studies with lentiviral small interfering RNA-based
NAV3 silencing in Jurkat cells and in primary lymphocytes
showed enhanced interleukin 2 expression (but not CD25
expression). Thus, NAV3 may contribute to the growth,
differentiation, and apoptosis of CTCL cells as well as to the
skewing from Th1-type to Th2-type phenotype during disease
progression. NAV3, a novel putative haploinsufficient tumor
suppressor gene, is disrupted in most cases of the commonest
types of CTCL and may thus provide a new diagnostic tool.

Introduction

Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL) represent a heterogeneous
group of non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas, where the neoplastic cell is a
mature CD4+ T lymphocyte in most subtypes (1). The most
common subtypes of CTCL are mycosis fungoides and the leu-

kemic Se´zary syndrome, both of which are steadily increasing in
incidence (2, 3). Earlier, a number of recurrent, acquired
chromosomal alterations and the genes involved in them have
been identified in many hematopoietic malignancies (4) and in
non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas other than CTCL. These genetic lesions
have typically been either activation of proto-oncogenes as a result
of chromosome translocation or disruption of tumor suppressor
genes (5). However, no specific chromosomal aberration common
to a majority of CTCL cases has been described thus far.

A large variety of chromosomal aberrations, both numerical and
structural, have been detected in CTCL (6–9). Most of these
abnormalities have been nonclonal
in the early phases of the
disease. Clonal cytogenetic changes have been shown to precede the
histologically identifiable malignancy (6, 7, 10, 11), but CTCL studies
have been hampered by the presence of numerous reactive T-cells in
the skin lesions of CTCL and the difficulty of propagating the truly
malignant cells in in vitro. In a previous multicolor fluorescent in situ
hybridization (FISH) study, only two recurrent unbalanced trans-
locations, der(1)t(1;10)(p2;q2) and der(14)t(14;15)(q;q?), were
reported in 2 of 17 patients with Se´zary syndrome (9). Chromosome
12 aberrations were common, as two of six patients with a
chromosomal clone showed a structural and three patients a
numerical aberration of chromosome 12 (9). Previous G-banding
studies have shown chromosome 12 abnormalities with a notable
frequency (9).

The aim of our study was to identify recurrent chromosomal
changes, and genes involved therein, in CTCL by using molecular
cytogenetic tools. First, multicolor FISH showed that the chromo-
some most often affected in a series of seven patients with Se´zary
syndrome was chromosome 12, with recurrent break points in
12q21 or 12q22. We fine-mapped the break points of overlapping
deletions and by observing a translocation in the minimal common
region of the deletions, were able to identify a putative target gene
NAV3, either deleted or disrupted by the translocation. Finally, we
showed NAV3 deletion in the majority of 21 randomly selected
patients representing different stages of CTCL.

Materials and Methods

Patient samples. Peripheral blood samples of seven consecutively
diagnosed patients with Se´zary syndrome and five randomly selected
patients with mycosis fungoides (Table 1) were studied with multicolor
FISH. Touch preparations of snap-frozen skin or lymph node biopsies from
eight of these patients (1–3, 8–12), skin samples from one other Se´zary
syndrome patient (case 13), and 12 further randomly selected mycosis
fungoides patients (cases 14-25) were available for locus-specific FISH.
Altogether, 8 of the 25 patients had early-stage mycosis fungoides (stages

lines and reference samples, cell viability, and apoptosis
analyses. For immunofluorescence and Western blot analyses, two human
neural cell lines and peripheral blood lymphocytes derived from healthy
voluntary subjects, and touch preparations of frozen skin biopsies from five
voluntary patients with inflammatory skin diseases, were used. The neural

For the reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assays, human fetal liver cDNA
library (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) and the human astrocyte-derived cell line,
CCF-STTG1 (a gift from professor Jorma Isola, University of Tampere,
Tampere, Finland), served as a reference (14). Also, a skin lesion biopsy of an
additional CTCL patient with translocation t(2;5)(p?23; q?21) was studied

lines were the neural crest–derived tumor cell

(data not shown). For lentiviral short hairpin RNA studies, the Jurkat E6-1
cell line and fresh peripheral blood lymphocytes from healthy donors were
used. Parallel cultures of nonstimulated and phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-
stimulated (KaryoMAX; Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD) cells were
used. Viable cells were identified with trypan blue and apoptotic cells with
the TUNEL method (ApopTaq Peroxidase in situ; Chemicon International,
Temecula, CA).

Multicolor fluorescent in situ hybridization. Conventional metaphase
preparations (7) of peripheral blood lymphocytes were analyzed either by
spectral karyotyping (15) or by multifluor FISH (16). Spectral karyotyping
was done as recommended by the manufacturer (Applied Spectral Imaging,
Migdal Haemek, Israel) and imaged with a SD200 Spectracube system
(Applied Spectral Imaging) on a Zeiss Axioskop microscope with a custom-
designed optical filter (SKY-1; Chroma Technology, Brattleboro, VT). For
multifluor FISH, the probe mixture (24XCyte-MetaSystems 24-color kit, with
B-tect kit; MetaSystems GmbH, Altlussheim, Germany) was used as
recommended by the manufacturer. Digital images were taken with an

analysis system (MetaSystems GmbH).

Locus-specific fluorescent in situ hybridization. Chromosomes 12
and 18 were further studied with locus-specific probes in cases from which
enough cell material was available (cases 1, 2, and 3). The region 12q14 to
12q21 was studied with 15 overlapping or contiguous yeast artificial
chromosome (YAC) probes of contig 12.4, the regions 12q12 to 12q13 and
12q22 to 12q24 with 10 other YACs (Fondation Jean Dausset, France), and
12q21 and 12q24 further with one bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)
and three P1-derived artificial chromosome (PAC) probes, respectively
(Research Genetics, Inc., Huntsville, AL). Chromosomal regions 18p11.2 to
18p11.3, 18q12.3, and 18q21 were studied with altogether 24 BACs and 4
YACs (Supplementary Data). All probes were selected using National Center
for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) databases (MapViewer program).
The probe identities were confirmed using PCR with locus-specific primers
according to NCBI databases. The YAC, BAC, and PAC DNAs were isolated
using routine techniques. The chromosomes were identified with centromere-
specific probes of chromosomes 12 (pA12H8) and 18 (p18R). All probes were
labeled with nick translation and dual-color hybridizations were done
(Supplementary Data) as previously described (7, 8, 17).

Fluorescent in situ hybridization on interphase nuclei. Touch
preparations of available snap-frozen skin or lymph node biopsies from
21 patients with mycosis fungoides or Se´zary syndrome, and of nine
reference skin samples (see above;
lupus erythematosus discoides or
eczema), were hybridized with two-color interphase fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH) as described earlier (11) with the following
modification: Digoxigenin-labeled BACs 136F16 and 36P3 were cohybridized
together with a centromere-specific probe labeled with biotin. The

translocation was detected with digoxigenin-labeled BACs 136F16 and
P36P3 with biotin-labeled BACs 786A1 and 494K17. At least 50 interphase
nuclei were analyzed for each patient. A nucleus with an equal number of
fluorescence signals from the centromere probe and the BAC probes was
considered normal and a deletion was recorded if the centromere probe
gave a higher number of signals from the centromere than from the BAC
areas. In a translocation, the distance of green and red signals is altered. The
analyses were done blinded to the diagnosis or sample identity. The highest
percentage of cells with aberrant signal patterns observed in reference
samples was considered as cutoff level.

Comparative genomic hybridization. Comparative genomic hybrid-

ization was done as described previously (8).

Sequencing and denaturing high-performance liquid chromato-
graphy. All exons and one intron region (intron 20) of the NAV3 gene in
blood cell-derived DNA of two patients (cases 1 and 3) were amplified with
primers specific for each exon or the intron and sequenced with ABIPRISM
310 sequencer. The primer sequences and PCR conditions are available on
request. All exons of cases 2, 4, 5, 6, and 13 were studied with denaturing
high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) as described before (18).
Exons showing abnormalities were sequenced. The mutation and poly-
morphisms were sequenced in reverse direction, too. To study the frequency
of sequence variations in the normal population, exon 37 and intron 35 in
the DNA samples of 50 healthy volunteers and all exons from one healthy
control sample were amplified and sequenced.

Immunofluorescence.

Immunofluorescence analysis,

imaging, and
analyses were done as described earlier (11). For the demonstration of
NAV3 protein, a polyclonal rabbit antibody, produced against a 19-mer
synthetic peptide (residues 212-230, exon 10 of NAV3; ref. 14), was used on
cytospin preparations of the neural tumor cell
line, Paju (13), normal
lymphocytes, and touch preparations from frozen skin biopsies of six CTCL

patients and of five reference patients with inflammatory skin diseases. For
cultured and lentivirally infected cells, the following additional antibodies
were used: monoclonal mouse anti–interleukin 2 (IL-2; R&D Systems
Europe, Ltd., Abingdon, United Kingdom), anti-CD25 (DAKOCytomation,
Glostrup, Denmark), anti–green fluorescent protein (GFP; Molecular Probes,
Leiden, the Netherlands), and polyclonal goat anti–IL-4 (Santa Cruz, Santa
Cruz, CA), and rabbit anti-GFP (Molecular Probes) antibodies. Secondary
antibodies were used as described previously (Supplementary Data; ref. 11).
Double stainings with anti-GFP antibodies and other antibodies were done.
In all analyses, 50 to 100 cells were examined, as previously described (11),
with a computer-connected UV microscope (Olympus BX50, Tokyo, Japan)
equipped with a charged coupled device camera.

NAV3 expression by reverse transcription-PCR and Western blot.
The expression of NAV3 mRNA was studied by RT-PCR in fresh and PHA-
stimulated (3d) normal blood lymphocytes (Life Technologies Invitrogen,
Rockville, MD), in the skin lesion biopsies of case 15 and in human fetal
liver cDNA library (Clontech). The human astrocyte-derived cell line, CCF-
STTG1 (see above), served as a reference (14). For performance, see
Supplementary Data.

For Western blot, aliquots of two neural cell lines (Paju and SH-SY5Y) and
both fresh and PHA-stimulated normal lymphocytes were used. The cells
were suspended in 2 SDS-PAGE sample buffer (100 AL/106 cells), boiled for
10 minutes, sheared by repeated passage through a 20-gauge needle, and
centrifuged to remove the insoluble material. After resolving in 12% SDS-
PAGE (Mini-Protean 3 Cell, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) along with
prestained SDS-PAGE Standards Broad Range (Bio-Rad Laboratories), the
proteins were transferred to Trans-Blot Transfer Medium nitrocellulose
membranes (Bio-Rad Laboratories), probed with anti-NAV3 rabbit antise-
rum (1:500 at 4jC overnight; ref. 14), washed [TBS (pH 7.4) and 0.05%
Tween 20], and detected with peroxidase antirabbit IgG (1:500; Vector
Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA) and peroxidase substrate kit DAB
(Vector Laboratories).

Flow cytometry analyses. Expression of CD4, CD25, and IL-2 on NAV3-
silenced (see below) and nonsilenced Jurkat E6-1 cells and peripheral blood
lymphocytes was investigated with fluorescence-activated cell sorter
(FACSCalibur; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). As primary antibodies,
monoclonal mouse anti-CD4, anti-CD25, or isotype control antibodies
(DAKOCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark), and as secondary antibody
polyclonal antimouse IgG conjugated with phycoerythrin (Jackson Immu-
noResearch, West Grove, PA), were used. Intracellular IL-2 detection was
done on fixed and permeabilized (0.1% saponin in buffer) cells by indirect
staining with monoclonal mouse anti–IL-2 (R&D Systems Europe) and
phycoerythrin-conjugated polyclonal antibodies. Before staining, the cells
were incubated 4 to 6 hours with 1 Ag/mL GolgiPlug (PharMingen, San
Diego, CA) to inhibit cytokine secretion. Gating was done on forward and
side-angle scatter characteristics and GFP expression of the cells.

NAV3 gene silencing with small interfering RNA-expressing lenti-
virus constructs. Several DNA sequences encoding small interfering RNA
(siRNA) precursors based on the NAV3 sequence were cloned in the
lentiviral vector pLL3.7 for expression under the U6 promoter, including
GFP expression ( from a separate polII promoter).9 Their inhibitory
potential was tested by cotransfection into HeLa cells with renilla luciferase
control plasmid (phRL-null; Promega, Madison, WI) and a h-actin
promoter-driven firefly luciferase expression vector (psiRNA-luc) into which
a relevant fragment of NAV3 cDNA had been inserted between the luciferase
open reading frame and the polyadenylation signal (psiRNA-luc NAV3;
psiRNA-luc is an unpublished vector provided by Tiina Tissari,
IMT,
Tampere, Finland). Two days after transfection, firefly/renilla luciferase
ratios were compared in cells transfected with the parental pLL3.7 or its
siRNA-encoding derivatives with psiRNA-luc or psiRNA-luc NAV3. The most
potent and specific inhibition was observed with a pLL3.7-derivative
carrying a 23-nucleotide sequence from the NAV3 exon 19 (bp 4,623-4,645),
which was named pLL3.7siRNA4. This derivative was used for production of

infectious short hairpin RNA–expressing lentiviruses as follows: The pLL3.7
or pLL3.7-siRNA4 constructs were transfected into 293T cells together with
pDELTA-8.9 (19) and pVSVg (envelope); cells were gently washed 12 hours
after transfection; and the supernatant was collected 48 hours later, filter,
and pelleted. For infection, a total of 107 Jurkat E6-1 cells were infected with
40 AL of concentrated virus at 37jC for 2 hours, and the number of infected
cells (GFP-positive) were estimated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS). The NAV3 expression of FACS-sorted (BD FACSAria; BD
Biosciences) GFP-positive cells (pLL3.7 or pLL3.7siRNA4) was studied with
quantitative RT-PCR by Light Cycler device (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim,
Germany) according to previously published guidelines (20). For primer and
cycling conditions, see Supplementary Data.

Interleukin-2 analysis of culture supernatants. IL-2 concentration
was analyzed with Quantikine IL-2 ELISA kit (Quantikine Immunoassay,
R&D) according to the instructions of the manufacturer.

Results

Aberrations of chromosome 12 are frequently found in
cutaneous T-cell lymphoma patients. The most often affected
chromosome in the peripheral blood clones observed by multifluor
FISH or spectral karyotyping was chromosome 12. Five of seven
consecutive patients with Se´zary syndrome showed a clonal
structural aberration of chromosome 12 and one (case 7) showed
a nonclonal deletion of 12q with a clonal monosomy of chromosome
12 (Fig. 1; Table 1; Supplementary Data). Five of the six mycosis
fungoides patients studied showed nonclonal deletions of chromo-
some 12 (Table 1). All structural clonal aberrations of chromosome
12 involved bands q21 or 22. Structural aberrations of chromosome
17 were also detected in five Se´zary syndrome patients, but these
aberrations could involve either p or q (Table 1). Three cases (cases 1,
3, and 4) showed a translocation with chromosome 18 in multifluor
FISH. One had a balanced translocation with 18q (case 3) and
another showed a translocation with 18p with loss of much of the
12q-arm (case 1; Fig. 1; Table 1; Supplementary Data).

Specification of the break point in chromosome 12. The
aberrations of cases 1, 2, and 3 were further studied with locus-
specific FISH. Cases 1 and 2 showed large deletions of
chromosome 12, del(12)(q15q15)(q21.1 q24), and del(12)(q12q21),
respectively (Fig. 2). The balanced translocation of case 3 was
within the minimal common region of deletions in cases 1 and 2,
and divided the signal of YAC 855F7 between chromosomes 12
and 18 (Fig. 2), enabling us to fine map the gene affected. The

chromosome 12q in the translocation (Fig. 2; Supplementary Data).
Although most of the material lost from the aberrant 12q in case 1
was totally deleted ( for comparative genomic hybridization, see
ref. 8), a small part of 12q24 was translocated to 18p (PAC 144J4;
Fig. 2) and to the region of BAC 683L23,
the latter partly
translocated to 12q24. Other more proximal BACs studied in 18p
remained in their respective locations.

NAV3 deletion/translocation is found in interphase cells of
skin lesions of cutaneous T-cell
lymphoma patients. The
translocation observed in blood lymphocytes of one Se´zary
syndrome patient (case 3) was also observed in the locus-specific
FISH to his lesional skin touch preparation (Table 1; Fig. 4). Deletions
of the NAV3 gene were observed in solid tissue samples from the
three other Se´zary syndrome patients studied (case 1, lymph node;
cases 2 and 13, skin) and in the lesional skin from 11 of 17 (65%)
patients with various stages of mycosis fungoides (Table 1; Fig. 4).

Altogether, NAV3 deletions were found in the skin lesions from
four of eight (50%) patients with early mycosis fungoides (stages
IA-IIA), and a deletion or a translocation was observed in 11 of 13
(85%) patients with advanced mycosis fungoides or Se´zary
syndrome with locus-specific FISH (Table 1; Fig. 4). The deletion
was equally well found in touch preparations from archival liquid
nitrogen–stored skin samples as well as in more recent samples.
There was no consistent association between the NAV3 deletion

and the type of previous therapy (Table 1). All patients with NAV3
deletion or translocation had a frequently relapsing disease, despite
therapy, or had died of CTCL. Of the six patients not showing NAV3
deletion in their skin lesions, four had an early stage disease. Two
of them had received psoralen plus UVA irradiation or electron
beam therapy and one was untreated (case 17).

Demonstration of NAV3 mutation in the microscopically
intact allele. Of the blood lymphocyte DNA from the seven cases,
six with a cytogenetic aberration of 12q, studied with sequencing or
DHPLC, only one showed a missense mutation. Case 1 had a point
mutation G!A in exon 37 (cDNA nucleotides 10106643;
NM_019403), resulting in an amino acid change E2200K. Several
single-nucleotide polymorphisms or intronic deletions were
detected. Seven polymorphic variations have been recorded in
NAV3 coding region (NT_019546) and two of these changes
(4509G!A and 4830C!T; NM_019403) were observed in cases 1
and 3. Altogether, the NAV3 gene region, spanning f381 kb of
chromosomal sequence, contains 849 polymorphic sites. Thus, point
missense mutations in CTCL blood samples were not common.

NAV3 Gene Deletion / Translocation in CTCL

Figure 5. NAV3 protein is detected with polyclonal rabbit
anti-NAV3 peptide antibody in neural cell lines, in proliferating
normal peripheral blood lymphocytes, in lymphocytes of
inflammatory skin lesions, and in rare lymphocytes of a CTCL skin
lesion. In Western blot, NAV3 protein is detected in polyclonally
activated (PHA-stimulated) normal human T lymphocytes (lane 2)
and in the neural cell lines Paju and SH-SY5Y (lanes 4 and 5 ) but
not in resting, purified mononuclear blood cells (lane 3 ).
Preimmunization serum from the same animal served as control
(lane 6, Paju cell line; lane 7, PHA-stimulated normal human
lymphocytes). Bound antibodies were visualized using the
peroxidase substrate kit DAB (Vector Laboratories). Lane 1
represents molecular weight markers electrophoresed on the same
gel. Immunohostologically, NAV3 protein is detected in all
neural-origin cells (B, Paju cell line; C, Paju cell line, control
immunostaining with preimmunization rabbit serum), in about half
of the lymphocytes of an inflammatory (eczema) skin lesion
(D, touch preparation), and in a few lymphocytes of the skin lesion
of a CTCL patient (E, case 14). The bound anti-NAV3 antibody was
detected with Alexa Fluor 594 goat antirabbit IgG conjugate
(Molecular Probes). Positive fluorescence is seen as white signal in
the black-and-white image.

In frozen skin touch preparations,

expressed by cell
lines of neural origin and by polyclonally
activated T-lymphocytes, but not by resting normal human
lymphocytes (Fig. 5).
the
proportion of NAV3-expressing lymphocytes was lower in six
CTCL patients with NAV3 deletion (median 18%, range 4-46%)
when compared with five samples from reference inflammatory
skin disorders (median 44%, range 20-52%). The difference was not
statistically significant with Mann-Whitney U-test.

The effect of NAV3 silencing in lymphoid cells enhances
interleukin-2 production. The lentiviral infection efficacy in Jurkat
cells was 40% as indicated by the GFP reporter gene. The lentiviral
silencing lowered the relative expression of NAV3 by 77% as
measured by Light Cycler (Fig. 6A). NAV3 transcriptional silencing
did not effect the viability of the infected Jurkat cells or primary
lymphocytes, but a slight growth advantage, of 8% in average, in the
NAV3-silenced cells was observed compared with those infected
with the empty vector. The rate of apoptotic cell death was
somewhat increased in the NAV3-silenced Jurkat cell cultures (5-10%
TUNEL-positive nuclei compared with 1%, respectively). Neither did
the silencing of NAV3 effect CD4 or CD25 expression as detected
with FACS or immunofluorescence analyses. By FACS analysis, NAV3
silencing increased the proportion of IL-2+/GFP+ Jurkat cells from
12% to 35% (Fig. 6B). The finding was confirmed by double
immunofluorescence in both unstimulated and PHA-stimulated
Jurkat cells: Unstimulated Jurkat cells with no NAV3 silencing
(pLL3.7 or native Jurkat) showed <10% clearly IL-2–positive cells and
a very weak IL-2 expression in the majority of the cells. In contrast,

70% of the siRNA4-producing Jurkat cells were positive for IL-2.
Upon PHA stimulation, 70% to 90% of Jurkat cells infected with the
empty vector (pLL3.7, GFP-positive) showed weak IL-2 positivity,
and 96% to 100% of the GFP-positive pLL3.7siRNA4 Jurkat cells
showed IL-2 positivity (Supplementary Data). Similar findings were
observed in primary lymphocytes. The result was confirmed with IL-
2 ELISA of culture supernatants showing f40% higher concentra-
tion of IL-2 in NAV3-silenced (pLL3.7-siRNA4) primary lymphocyte
cultures compared with corresponding empty vector-infected
lymphocyte cultures (74 pg/mL compared with 12 pg/mL, or 549
pg/mL compared with 369 pg/mL, respectively, at various time
points of culture). No comparative significant effect on IL-4
expression was observed (data not shown).

Discussion

Our aim was to identify recurrent chromosomal alterations
associated with the development or progression of CTCL by
molecular cytogenetic techniques. First, we found that a deletion or
translocation of the q-arm of chromosome 12 was the most
common recurrent change detected by multicolor FISH in the
blood lymphocytes in six of seven (86%) consecutively presenting
Se´zary syndrome patients. Three of them, studied with locus-
specific FISH, showed a deletion or translocation of the human
homologue of unc-53, the NAV3 (also named POMFIL1). A deletion
of NAV3 region was subsequently observed in the skin lesions from
11 of 17 (65%) randomly selected mycosis fungoides patients.

Figure 6. NAV3 expression was silenced and, consequently, IL-2 expression
was increased in cells infected with PLL3.7siRNA4 compared with cells infected
with an empty vector PLL3.7. A, the relative expression of NAV3 mRNA (NAV3/
TBP) by quantitative RT-PCR was lower in cells infected with PLL3.7siRNA4
compared with cells infected with PLL3.7. B, the percentage of IL-2–positive
cells of all GFP-positive cells increased in cells infected with PLL3.7siRNA4
once or twice compared with cells infected with PLL3.7.

Previous cytogenetic studies have suggested that aberrations of
12q are among the most common alterations in CTCL (6, 9), but
the reported frequencies of chromosomal abnormalities have been
influenced by the detection methods used (9). Only techniques
such as multicolor FISH or spectral karyotyping, which enable the
identification of the rearranged chromosome parts and reveal the
composition of aberrations (designated only as markers in G-
banding; ref. 12), made the present findings possible. In a review of
274 karyotypes (most of
the most
commonly observed aberrations, those of 1p, occurred in 11% of
cases, whereas structural aberration of 12q were found in 7% of the
CTCL cases. Previously, we detected nonclonal aberrations of 12q
in the blood of 8 of 10 mycosis fungoides patients (data not shown)
and a clonal aberration in only one patient (7). However, when the
skin lesions of five of the first mentioned cases (cases 8, 15, 16, 20,
and 21) were studied with locus-specific FISH in this study, four of
them showed a deletion of NAV3. One (case 15) showed later a
clonal deletion in 12q in blood G-banding. The fifth patient with no
NAV3 deletion (case 16) has remained in remission for over 10
years now (10).

them G-banded; ref. 9),

Our finding that the aberration type in 12q was deletion strongly
suggests that the region harbors a tumor suppressor gene. The two

Se´zary syndrome patients studied, with long deletions proximally and
distally in 12q, showed the minimal common region in 12q21 covered
by a seven-YAC-long contig, with approximate size of 6 Mb. This
region may well contain tens or hundreds of genes. By serendipity, a
third Se´zary syndrome patient showed a balanced translocation with
break point right in the middle of the minimal region of deletion.
Reciprocal translocations, even from one donor chromosome to
several recipient chromosomes, have often pinpointed the location of
target tumor suppressor genes, as was the case for example for the
retinoblastoma gene (21). The mapping of translocation break point
in the above-mentioned Se´zary syndrome patient showed that the
translocation disrupted a gene for the human homologue of unc-53,
the NAV3 (also named POMFIL1; refs. 14, 22).

The function of NAV3 in human lymphoid cells has not been
known previously and NAV3 was thus an unexpected target of the
recurrent aberration associated with CTCL. Association of the
reduced or absent expression of NAV3/POMFIL1 has been reported
in neuroblastoma cell lines (14). The NAV3 gene is large, spanning
around 400 kb of genomic sequence, and has only recently been
cloned, although not in full length (14, 22). NAV3 is one of the three
human homologues of unc-53, a gene involved in axonal elongation
in Caenorhabditis elegans (22–24). NAV3 consists of 40 exons and is
expressed in brain, placenta, and colon. NAV3 has apparently arisen
through duplication of NAV1 and NAV2 (HELAD1, RAINB1). In
particular, NAV3 shows a complexity of splicing events (14, 22). All
three NAV proteins have an AAA domain characteristic of ATPases,
and ATP/GTP binding sites (P-loops). NAV3 shows a large number of
phosphorylation sites, a leucine zipper domain, coiled-coil domain,
potential SH3-binding sites (14), as well as calponin-like (CH)
domains (22), suggesting that NAV3 may be involved in cellular
signaling (25). Mouse NAV3/POMFIL1 was recently shown to locate
in nuclear pore complexes (14), which may indicate a function in
nucleocytoplasmic transport regulation, cell cycle regulation, and
kinetochore formation (26). Like NAV2, NAV3 also shows the
properties of a helicase and exonuclease as predicted by its protein
sequence (27). Helicases have a role in the maintenance of the
stability of chromosomes, and their deficiency, like that of BLM and
WRN, could cause a hyperrecombination phenotype, with deletion
mutants and possibly also loss of heterozygosity and increase in
sister chromatid exchanges, observed in CTCL, too (28–30). Thus, a
defective NAV3 might, with other possible defects, contribute to the
genomic instability observed in CTCL (31).

In classic tumor suppressor genes, inactivation of the remaining
allele of the gene, either through mutation or by epigenetic events
(such as promoter hypermethylation), is often found. Of the six
studied patients with a deletion or translocation in NAV3, one had a
missense mutation showing that both alleles were aberrant. The
functional consequence of the mutation is difficult to predict.
Whether NAV3 is hypermethylated in CTCL needs to be studied.
Another possibility is that the loss of one copy of the gene causes a
functional dose effect as is the case with the more recently described
nonclassic haploinsufficient tumor suppressor genes (32–34).

The deletion of NAV3 seems to be a relatively early event during
the pathogenesis of CTCL because it is detectable with locus-
specific FISH in the skin of half of the patients with early mycosis
fungoides (stages IA-IIB) compared with 85% of cases with a later
stage CTCL. In previous studies, genetic aberrations of some
known tumor suppressor genes, like PTEN, p15, p16, and p53, or
overexpression of the latter, have been observed, but each with
lower frequencies than deletions of NAV3, especially at early stages
of the disease (29, 35–38).

To understand the functional consequences of NAV3 deficiency,
we infected lymphoid cell cultures with a NAV3 expression-
inhibiting siRNA construct (designed against exon 19 of NAV3).
Interestingly, NAV3 silencing increased the IL-2 expression in Jurkat
cells, as well as in primary lymphocytes stimulated with PHA, as
shown by double immunofluorescence (IL-2/GFP), FACS analysis,
and by secreted IL-2 levels. IL-2 is known to promote growth,
differentiation, and/or apoptosis of lymphoid cells (39). We did not
find a comparative effect on IL-4 expression, the other cytokine
relevant in Se´zary syndrome. Unexpectedly, no up-regulation of
CD25 (IL-2Ra) was found.

This preliminary finding of NAV3 functional properties in
lymphocytes would explain earlier observations that the malignant
cells in mycosis fungoides preferentially express Th1 cytokines, like
IL-2 and IFN-g, and along with disease progression a skewing toward
a type 2 cytokine profile (IL-4) occurs (40, 41). Also, IL-2 has been
shown to play a critical role in the polarization of naı¨ve CD4 T cells
toward the Th2 phenotype by stabilizing the accessibility of the IL-4
gene (42), and, thus, an enhanced expression of IL-2 because early
mycosis fungoides (as a consequence of NAVB3 gene deletion) might
explain the Th2 skewing in Se´zary syndrome. That we did not
observe a concomitant increase in IL-2Ra expression would also fit
earlier observations showing that only a minority of mycosis
fungoides tumors do express CD25, the expression being dependent
on tissue site (1, 43). Also, a slightly reduced CD25 mRNA expression
has been found in Se´zary syndrome patient cells following IL-2
induction (44).

Recently, a loss of IL-2–inducible Stat5-dependent gene expres-
sion has been observed in Se´zary syndrome patients, and the T cells
of patients showed a marked inability to express transcription-
competent full-length Stat5 protein in the nucleus even after potent
activation (e.g., IL-2 treatment) but rather a dominance of the
truncated Stat5t protein (44). The Stat5 gene is not known to be
aberrated, but a constitutive activation of both Stat3 and Stat5 have
been observed in Se´zary syndrome (45, 46). The IL-2–induced
proliferative signals to T cells are mediated by two IL-2R–coupled
pathways, one involving activation of Stat5 (46). The up-regulation
of CD25 in response to IL-2 also requires functionally active
Stat5 (47). Interestingly, the NAV homologue UNC-53 interacts with
SEM-5, the nematode homologue of human GRB2, an inter-
mediator in, e.g., proliferative cell signaling in T lymphocytes
(24, 48, 49). Thus, we may hypothesize that the IL-2 proliferative
signaling in CTCL cells is aberrantly regulated by some NAV3
interactome-associated, as yet undefined mechanism. Our observa-

NAV3 Gene Deletion / Translocation in CTCL

tions of the functional consequences of NAV3 silencing would thus
provide some gene level explanation for the previous observations of
signaling defects in CTCL cells. NAV3 may well be haploinsufficient,
because unc53H2, the mammalian NAV2 homologue, shows gene
dosage effects for development and behavior in mice (34).

Also, these preliminary results give a hint toward the signaling
in future

pathways that should be explored more in detail
experiments.

The deletion of 12q and the target gene, NAV3,

is the first
chromosomal/gene aberration found to be associated with the
majority of the most common forms of CTCL. We believe that the
demonstration of NAV3 deletion/translocation with, e.g., FISH in
fresh or fixed tissue samples will provide a new diagnostic aid,
facilitating the early diagnosis of mycosis fungoides as well as the
follow-up of a residual disease. Namely, the diagnosis of mycosis
fungoides is often notoriously difficult in the early stages when
histologic features are nonspecific.11 The only molecular marker
currently in use, and with relatively high specificity,
is the
demonstration of T-cell clonality by T-cell receptor (TCR) gene (50,
51). The chromosomal clones are at least as sensitive and specific as
TCR-rearranged clones (52), and NAV3-deleted clones would now
provide a new marker for 50% of the early cases of mycosis fungoides
and for 85% of the more advanced cases. It is obvious that also other
aberrations are required to explain the complex pathogenesis of
CTCL, and various subgroups of CTCL are expected to be revealed
through the identification of these additional aberrations.
