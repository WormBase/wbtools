Abstract
The pathway to cell death in Caenorhabditis elegans is well
established.
the Bcl-2
homology domain 3 (BH3)-only protein EGL-1 binds to CED-9
at the mitochondrial membrane to cause the release of CED-4,
which oligomerises and facilitates the activation of
the
caspase CED-3. However, despite many studies, the biophy-
sical features of the CED-4/CED-9 complex have not been fully
characterised. Here, we report the puriﬁcation of a soluble
and stable 2 : 2 heterotetrameric complex formed by recom-
binant CED-4 and CED-9 coexpressed in bacteria. Consistent
with previous studies, synthetic peptides corresponding to
the BH3 domains of worm BH3-only proteins (EGL-1, CED-13)
dissociate CED-4 from CED-9, but not
from the gain-of-
function CED-9 (G169E) mutant. Surprisingly, the ability of
worm BH3 domains to dissociate CED-4 was speciﬁc since
mammalian BH3-only proteins could not do so.

Introduction

Much of our current understanding of
the pathways to
programmed cell death has been learned from genetic
analysis of the nematode Caenorhabitditis elegans.1 In this
organism, three genes essential for the execution of apoptosis
have been identiﬁed, namely ced-3, ced-4,2 and egl-1,3

whereas another, ced-9, antagonizes cell death.4 In healthy
cells, the adapter CED-4 associates with CED-9, the worm
lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) orthologue, on mitochondrial
B-cell
membranes.5 When the cell
receives a death signal,
transcriptionally upregulated Bcl-2 homology domain 3
(BH3)-only protein EGL-1 binds CED-9. This, in turn, releases
CED-4 allowing its oligomerisation and leads to the activation
of the caspase CED-3 which is synthesised as an inactive
zymogen.6 CED-4 facilitates proteolytic autoactivation of
CED-3 by bringing CED-3 zymogens into close proximity
through interactions between their caspase-recruitment

domains (CARDs) (Figure 1). However,
whether the CED-4/CED-9 complex at
the mitochondrial
membrane contains CED-3 constitutively, although during cell
death, CED-4 dissociates from CED-9 and translocates from
the mitochondrial to the nuclear membrane.5

it

This pathway of protein interactions has been extensively
studied using a myriad of techniques. For example, interaction
of CED-4 with CED-9 (and simultaneously with CED-3) has
been demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation of proteins
expressed in various cell
two-hybrid
system,9–11 or by colocalization studies.5,12,13 These have
been complemented by mutational analysis of both CED-4
and CED-9.9,10,14 Similarly, numerous studies have demon-
strated the interaction between CED-9 and EGL-1, and
release and/or redistribution of CED-4 from the mitochon-
dria.3,12,14–16

types,6–8 the yeast

Recently, three-dimensional structures were determined for
the Bcl-2 homology region of CED-9 alone,16 and in complex
with an EGL-1 fragment encompassing its BH3 domain,14
conﬁrming the structural similarity with the mammalian Bcl-2
prosurvival family members17,18 and their mode of engage-
ment with BH3 domains.19–21 These structures of CED-9
suggest a mechanism by which CED-4 is released from
CED-9. Binding of EGL-1 through its BH3 domain to a
hydrophobic cleft in CED-9 results in a substantial structural
rearrangement in CED-9, which is proposed to disrupt binding
to CED-4 at a second site on CED-9.14 The CED-9/EGL-1
complex structure also explained a ced-9 gain-of-function
mutation that prevents most somatic cell deaths in C.
elegans.22 This mutation substitutes the highly conserved
glycine residue at position 169 with glutamic acid and
prevents EGL-1-induced release of CED-4, but preserves
CED-4 binding to CED-9.5,8,15 The CED-9/EGL-1 complex
structure shows that the replacement of glycine with glutamic
acid would introduce a steric clash with EGL-1,
thereby
negatively affecting its binding.14

The three-dimensional structure of the mammalian homo-
logue of CED-4, apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (APAF-1),
with WD40 domains deleted, has also recently been solved.23
This structure showed a relatively compact protein of ﬁve
distinct domains with the amino terminal CARD at one end
and the C-terminus at the other (Figure 1). An ADP molecule
was found deeply buried within the protein at the junction of
four domains and appears to serve as an organising centre to

Characterization of the CED-4/CED-9 complex

Figure 1 Domain architecture of CED-4 and CED-9. CED-4 consists of an N-
terminal caspase recruitment domain (CARD) required for binding CED-3 and a
C-terminal nucleotide-binding domain shared by APAF-1, certain plant R gene
products and CED-4 (NB-ARC). The subdomain structure shown is taken from
the APAF-1 structure.23 CED-9 has an N-terminal domain, a central domain
homologous to mammalian Bcl-2 prosurvival proteins, and a C-terminal
hydrophobic transmembrane segment that was deleted in all constructs used

lock the molecule into an inactive state. Owing to the packing
of
the CED-4 CARD in this structure, a conformational
change, presumably as a consequence of ATP hydrolysis, is
required for interaction with the caspase-9 prodomain.

Most of the above functional studies on the CED-3/CED-4/
CED-9 interaction and its modulation by EGL-1 have been
done in cell-based assays, and have thus not addressed
relevant biophysical questions regarding these macromole-
cular complexes, although some attempts at characterising
recombinant proteins have been reported. For example, it has
been shown that recombinant CED-4 produced in insect cells
spontaneously oligomerises,24 a result consistent with studies
indicating that CED-9 prevents CED-4 oligomerisation.6 Gel-
ﬁltration chromatography estimates of the mass of the CED-4
oligomers produced from the various constructs used in this
study ranged from 500 to 1500 kDa. However, no studies to
date have addressed the question of the size and stoichio-
metry of the CED-9/CED-4 complex. In this paper we report,
for the ﬁrst time, high-level expression of recombinant CED-4/
CED-9 complex in bacteria. This puriﬁed protein complex is a
2 : 2 heterotetramer and responds predictably to treatment
with EGL-1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the trigger
required for release of CED-9 from CED-4 is highly speciﬁc
since it can only be initiated by worm, but not mammalian,
BH3-only proteins.

Results

Expression and puriﬁcation of CED-4/CED-9
complex

To study the biochemical properties of the adapter molecule
CED-4, we initially attempted to express either the full-length
protein or its predicted domains in Escherichia coli. These
fragments included the N-terminal CARD, the nucleotide-
binding domain shared by APAF-1, certain R gene products
and CED-4 (NB-ARC) or a shorter form of the NB-ARC that
just encompassed the P-loop ATP-binding domain (Figure 1).
In all cases, relatively high levels of protein were expressed
(mg/l of culture) but their poor solubility precluded us from
purifying and characterising them in detail.

To circumvent this problem, we attempted coexpressing
CED-4 with its physiological binding partner, CED-9,9 using
a dual expression vector. Although most of
the CED-4

sufﬁcient soluble material to allow puriﬁcation of a complex of

bacterial culture) of the protein complex was isolated from
the soluble fraction of bacterial
lysates using a two-step
puriﬁcation protocol involving an initial Nickel-afﬁnity puriﬁca-
tion step (employing the hexahistidine tag on the N-terminus
of CED-4) followed by a gel-ﬁltration chromatography step
(Figure 2a–c). Typically,

of protein complexes recovered from the Nickel-afﬁnity
puriﬁcation indicated that, in some preparations, up to one-
third of the puriﬁed material was a soluble high molecular
weight aggregate, which eluted near the column void volume
(Figure 2a, Peak I). Western blot analysis of this peak showed
that it, like the major peak (Figure 2a, Peak II), contained both
CED-4 and CED-9, although unlike the major peak it includes
a putative CED-9 degradation product (Figure 2c). The Peak I
complex also displayed a relatively high absorbance at
340 nm, suggesting that it may be a soluble protein aggregate.
Therefore, subsequent studies used only the major fraction
eluted in Peak II (Figure 2a).

We tested two different CED-9 constructs in the coexpres-
sion studies: one lacking its C-terminal hydrophobic tail (CED-
9DC) and another in which both the hydrophobic tail and the
amino-terminal 67 residues were removed (CED-9DNDC)
(Figure 1). The gel-ﬁltration proﬁles of the complex containing
either of these CED-9 constructs were very similar (data not
shown). As the CED-9DNDC protein expressed alone was
generally more soluble, and thus more readily amenable for
further characterisation, we focused our efforts on complexes
formed between this protein and CED-4. In fact, puriﬁed CED-
4/CED-9DNDC complex could be concentrated to reasonably
high levels (430 mg/ml) without further aggregation apparent,
as judged by re-chromatography on a size-exclusion column.
This complex was also stable after up to 2 weeks storage at
41C with the appearance of only a minor peak (less than 20%
of total protein) corresponding to the CED-9DNDC protein in
the size-exclusion proﬁle upon rechromatography (data not
shown).

We were similarly able to express and purify a complex of
the NB-ARC/CED-9DNDC, indicating that the CARD of CED-
4 is dispensable for binding to CED-9 (Figure 2d) This is
consistent with previous reports.10 Interestingly, deletion of
just ﬁve residues from the C-terminus of CED-4, however,
prevented production of soluble complex.

Stoichiometry of the CED-4/CED-9DNDC complex
Coomassie Blue staining of the CED-4/CED-9DNDC complex
(Peak II in Figure 2a) on SDS-PAGE gels suggested that the
ratio of CED-4 to CED-9DNDC may be greater than 1 : 1, as
the CED-4 band appeared signiﬁcantly more intense
(Figure 2b). This was the case whether the complex was
isolated using the Nickel-afﬁnity column alone, or in conjunc-
tion with gel-ﬁltration chromatography.

To perform a more quantitative analysis of the stoichiometry
of the protein complex, it was subjected to six cycles of amino-
terminal sequencing. Accurate values for amino-acid abun-

Table 1 Amino terminal sequencing of the CED-4/CED-9 complex

dance on each cycle could be readily obtained for all amino
acids except aspartates due to technical limitations. The ratio
of abundance of CED-9 residues to CED-4 residues was very
close to a stoichiometric 1 : 1 ratio (Table 1). This suggests
that the staining pattern observed on the SDS-PAGE gel may
be due to preferential staining of CED-4 or poor staining of
CED-9. Such anomalous staining has been reported for other
proteins, such as certain surface proteins of Candida
albicans.25

Size and solution properties of the CED-4/CED-
9DNDC complex

The majority of the puriﬁed protein complex in more than 10
different preparations eluted at a retention time (Peak II,
Figure 2a) on gel-ﬁltration consistent with a complex of
approximately 180–200 kDa. This mass estimate, determined
from calibration curves on several different columns (e.g. see
inset, Figure 2a),
together with the stoichiometry data
(Table 1), suggested that the complex might be a hetero-
tetramer consisting of two molecules each of CED-4 and
CED-9DNDC, for which the calculated mass is 175 kDa. The
apparent size on gel ﬁltration was the same regardless of
whether the FLAG tag was present at the amino terminus of
the CED-9DNDC, indicating that artiﬁcial dimerisation through
the FLAG tag was not responsible for the formation of the
complex (data not shown).

To get a more accurate assessment of the size of the
complex, analytical ultracentrifugation was performed. Sedi-
mentation velocity studies of
the complex were initially
conducted in Tris-buffered solution at a total protein concen-
tration of 1.0 mg/ml. The absorbance versus radial position
proﬁles are plotted at 6 min intervals in Supplementary Figure
1b. Continuous size-distribution analysis of this data yields an
excellent ﬁt
to a predominantly single species with a
sedimentation coefﬁcient (s20,w) of 7.5 S (Supplementary
Figure 1c), an apparent molar mass of 159 kDa and frictional
ratio of 1.40. This suggests that the CED-4/CED-9DNDC
complex may exist as either a 2 : 1 or 2 : 2 CED-4/CED-
9DNDC complex. Therefore,
to conﬁrm the quaternary
structure of the CED-4/CED-9DNDC complex, sedimentation
equilibrium experiments, which are independent of molecular
shape estimates and therefore give a more robust measure of
molecular mass,26 were also conducted at an initial protein
concentration of 1.0 mg/ml (Supplementary Figure 1d–f). The
nonlinear least-squares best-ﬁt yielded a molar mass of
18073.8 kDa, in excellent agreement with the theoretical
heterotetrameric mass of a 2 : 2 CED-4/CED-9DNDC complex
(175 kDa).

EGL-1 BH3 domain displaces CED-4 from CED-9

for the apoptosis pathway in worms
The current model
proposes that binding of
the BH3-only protein EGL-1 to
CED-9 results in displacement of bound CED-4.3,12,15 If this is
correct, we predict that the CED-4/CED-9 complex formed in
vitro (Figure 2a, Peak II) would be disrupted by EGL-1. When
the puriﬁed CED-4/CED-9DNDC complex was incubated with
a synthetic 26-mer peptide encompassing the BH3 domain of
EGL-1, a visible precipitate formed, which was removed by
centrifugation. Gel-ﬁltration chromatography of the soluble
material demonstrated dissociation of CED-4 from CED-
9DNDC, with essentially no protein detected where the
untreated complex normally elutes (Figure 3a,b). Only a peak
corresponding to an B25 kDa protein was detected, which on
Western blotting was shown to contain FLAG-tagged CED-
9DNDC (Figure 3c), but not CED-4. Instead, all of the CED-4
appeared to be contained in the insoluble pellet removed by
centrifugation prior to chromatography (see inset, Figure 3b).
Importantly, the release of the CED-4 from the complex
appeared to be dependent upon a speciﬁc interaction of the
EGL-1 BH3 peptide with wild-type CED-9. A single point
mutation in CED-9, substituting the highly conserved glycine
at position 169 with glutamate, which has been reported to
effect EGL-1 binding,8,15 completely prevented the EGL-1
BH3 domain peptide from displacing CED-4 (Figure 3d,e).
However, the ability of this mutant CED-9 to bind CED-4 was
unaffected (Figure 3d), which may explain why this mutant is

a more potent inhibitor of cell death4 since it can no longer be
restrained by EGL-1.

Similar results were obtained using isothermal

titration
microcalorimetry (Figure 4). In these studies, EGL-1 peptide
was titrated into the CED-4/CED-9DNDC complex. In the
initial EGL-1 peptide injections into the CED-4/CED-9DNDC-
containing solution, heat was released (Figure 4a), indicating
a binding event between the peptide and the complex.
However, a pronounced baseline shift was then observed
upon subsequent additions of peptide. This shift may be due
to aggregation/precipitation of CED-4 released from the
complex as the solution removed from the isothermal titration
calorimetry (ITC) cell at the completion of the titration was
noticeably turbid. SDS-PAGE analysis of the pellet postcen-
trifugation conﬁrmed that it contained predominantly CED-4
(data not shown). The system is thermodynamically complex
involving several potential reactions all of which release or
absorb heat (i.e. EGL-1 peptide binds CED-9, CED-4 release
from CED-9, CED-4 oligomerisation/precipitation), and hence
quantitative analysis of the data is difﬁcult.

However,

the results provide qualitative evidence that
aggregation of CED-4 occurs very soon after dissociation
from CED-9 (Figure 4a). When a complex containing the
CED-9DNDC (G169E) was similarly analysed, no initial heat
release or signiﬁcant baseline shift was observed (Figure 4b)
This conﬁrms our gel-ﬁltration results that EGL-1 BH3 could
not bind mutant CED-9DNDC (G169E) (Figure 3d,e).

Unlike worm BH3-only proteins, mammalian
BH3-only proteins cannot disrupt the CED-4/CED-9
complex

Using isothermal titration calorimetry, we were able to directly
determine the afﬁnity of EGL-1 BH3 peptide for
free
(uncomplexed) CED-9DNDC. The KD for this interaction was
approximately 25 nM, consistent with a previously reported
value (6 nM) measured by ITC using a comparable EGL-1
peptide.16 Recently, a second BH3-only protein, CED-13, was
discovered in the worm.27 Its BH3 domain sequence shows
signiﬁcant homology with that of EGL-1 (Figure 7), and over-
expression of CED-13 in C. elegans promotes apoptosis.27
We therefore compared the ability of CED-13 to bind CED-9
and found that the afﬁnity of a peptide spanning this BH3
domain was approximately four-fold lower (B100 nM) than
that of the EGL-1. Consistent with this, we observed that the
CED-13 BH3 peptide can also disrupt
the CED-4/CED-
9DNDC complex, but with lower efﬁciency as demonstrated
by a signiﬁcant proportion of the complex remaining after
treatment (Figure 5b).

Since both worm BH3-only proteins can displace CED-4
from CED-9, the evolutionary conservation of the cell death

pathways prompted us to test if mammalian BH3-only proteins
can also trigger this dissociation. As mammalian Bcl-2 can
function in worms,4,28 we wondered if mammalian BH3-only
proteins such as Bim, which can bind to all known mammalian
prosurvival proteins, could substitute for worm EGL-1. We
found instead that Bim BH3 peptide could not bind CED-
9DNDC in direct binding studies, using isothermal titration
calorimetry (data not shown), and consistent with this, Bim BH3
peptide did not disrupt the complex formed between CED-4
and CED-9DNDC (Figure 5c). Furthermore, synthetic peptides
corresponding to the BH3 domain sequence from several other
mammalian BH3-only proteins, Bid, Bad, Noxa or Puma, did
not cause any complex dissociation (data not shown).

To determine whether complex dissociation could involve
more than just the BH3 domain sequence, we examined the
ability of the promiscuous-binding full-length BimS protein to
interact with the CED-4/CED-9 complex. In an initial experi-
ment, bacterially expressed recombinant
full-length BimS
protein was used in place of the BH3 domain peptide. This
protein, as with the peptide, was unable to dissociate or
interact with the puriﬁed CED-4/CED-9 complex as
determined by both gel-ﬁltration and ITC experiments (data

unable to do so

Discussion

In C. elegans, the life-or-death fate of a cell is dependent upon
whether the adapter protein CED-4 is sequestered by CED-9.
In this manuscript we have shown for the ﬁrst time that the
CED-4/CED-9 complex can exist as a heterotetramer in
aqueous solution, with the size and stoichiometry of the
complex determined from gel-ﬁltration chromatography (Fig-
ure 2), N-terminal sequencing (Table 1) and analytical
ultracentrifugation (Supplementary Figure 1). This complex
is (coexpressed) at milligram per litre quantities in E. coli and
is highly soluble. In contrast, attempts to purify similar levels of
CED-4 alone were hindered by the protein’s insolubility and
tendency to aggregate into inclusion bodies. Previously, the
expression of soluble GST-fusions of CED-4 has been
reported,8,14,24 although the amounts of protein produced in
these studies is unclear, while other attempts to coexpress
CED-4 and CED-3 resulted only in the production of insoluble
proteins.29 While we cannot eliminate the possibility that the
CED-4/CED-9 complex known to be associated with the
mitochondrial membrane in the worm exists in a different
oligomeric form to that described here for the E. coli-derived
complex, our biochemical data for different complexes,
including mutants, are consistent with the features of the
protein complex characterised previously.5,6,8–10,12,15

For example, we have shown that the formation of the
complex is not dependent on the presence of the CARD of
CED-4, consistent with the requirement that it be free to recruit
CED-3 to a trimolecular complex of CED-3/CED-4/CED-9.7
This result agrees with other studies using yeast two-hybrid
assays showing a strong interaction between CED-9 and
CED-4 with its CARD deleted.10 Importantly, we also
demonstrated that the heterotetrameric CED-4/CED-9DNDC
complex dissociated upon incubation with a synthetic peptide
corresponding to the BH3 domain of EGL-1 providing
evidence that the complex produced here in E. coli behaves
functionally in a manner similar to that reported in transfected
cells (Figure 6)12,15 and in worms.5 Furthermore, we demon-
strated that introduction of the G169E gain-of-function muta-
tion into CED-9DNDC prevented EGL-1 BH3 peptide-induced

synthetic peptides corresponding to (b) CED-13 BH3 or (c) Bim BH3 prior to gel-
ﬁltration chromatography. Note the partial complex dissociation with CED-13 BH3
peptide, whereas addition of Bim BH3 had no impact

not shown). This was conﬁrmed in co-immunoprecipitation
experiments (Figure 6). In these experiments, expression of
EGL-1 prevented association of CED-4 with CED-9. However,
consistent with studies using bacterially- expressed recombi-
nant material, expression of Bims had no effect on complex
formation/dissociation (Figure 6). Taken together,
these
binding studies conﬁrm the selectivity of worm BH3-proteins
(EGL-1 and CED-13) for CED-9.

release of CED-4 from the complex as shown previously.5 In
addition, no binding was detected between the EGL-1 BH3
peptide and the complex involving this CED-9DNDC(G169E)
mutant
in our ITC studies. These results agree with the
previously observed failure of CED-4 to be released from
the mitochondria in cells expressing this CED-9 mutant,5 and
structural studies that show that
the G169E substitution
occludes the BH3-binding groove.14

Our experiments also support observations by others that,
in the absence of CED-9, CED-4 self-associates.5,24 Using
puriﬁed recombinant proteins, we have shown that following
EGL-1 BH3 peptide-induced release of CED-4 from CED-9,
CED-4 forms an insoluble aggregate. The ITC studies also
suggest that this aggregation occurs very soon after EGL-1
BH3 peptide-induced release from CED-9. This tendency for
CED-4 to aggregate/self-associate may explain why expres-
sion of high levels of soluble CED-4 in E. coli was not possible.
However, it may be the case that this aggregation process
would be less pronounced or, at least, more controlled if
CED-4 were bound to CED-3, as may be the case in cells.

rationale for

this observation.

We also examined the ability of BH3 domains from proteins
other than EGL-1 (Figure 5) to dissociate the CED-4/CED-
9DNDC complex. The BH3 domain sequence from another
nematode protein, CED-13, was able to displace CED-4 from
CED-9, although it was less effective than the EGL-1 peptide.
This weaker dissociating activity was reﬂected in the
approximately four-fold lower afﬁnity of the peptide for CED-9.
CED-13 binding to CED-9 in C. elegans has been reported,
although the proapoptotic phenotype of CED-13 is apparently
weaker than that of EGL-1.27 The weaker afﬁnity of CED-13
for CED-9DNDC compared to that of EGL-1 may provide a

Bim, Puma, Noxa, Bad, and Bid were completely ineffective at
dissociating the complex, consistent with the absence of
binding of Bim to free CED-9DNDC in our ITC studies. We
have previously shown that both Bim and Puma can bind with
high afﬁnity (dissociation equilibrium constants in the low
nanomolar range) to all known mammalian Bcl-2 family
proteins, while Noxa, Bad and Bid have more restricted
speciﬁcities.30 Among the central 16 residues at the core of
the BH3 domains illustrated in Figure 7, the EGL-1 sequence
is preserved at 10 of these positions in one or more of the
mammalian proteins. If the BH3 domains of all known human
BH3-only proteins30 are included in the comparison (although
not all have been assayed here), the number increases to 13
(or 14 if the Cys for Ser substitution is discounted). Thus, a
signiﬁcant residual of the worm EGL-1 sequence persists in
the BH3-only proteins in mammals, but none of those tested

here can displace CED-4 from CED-9. Hence, this inability of
BH3 domain sequences from mammalian BH3-only proteins
to displace CED-4 further illustrates aspects of the speciﬁcity
between BH3 domains and prosurvival molecules.

this binding surface involves neither

The observation that the CED-4/CED-9DNDC complex is
heterotetrameric has a number of implications. Site-directed
mutagenesis studies of CED-9 indicate that residues in a
surface patch adjacent to the BH3 domain-binding groove on
CED-9 are involved in the interaction with CED-4;14 however,
our data suggest
that a yet-to-be characterised binding
surface on either or both of the components is involved in
dimerisation of the CED-4/CED-9 complex. Further, our data
indicate that
the
membrane anchor nor the N-terminal 67 residues of CED-9.
The absence of evidence for a dimer of CED-9 in solution
suggests that CED-4 may mediate dimerisation of the CED-4/
CED-9DNDC complex. In that case, the NB-ARC would be
implicated in the homodimerisation of CED-4 as the complex
can be formed in the absence of
the CED-4 CARD.
Furthermore, our ﬁnding that deletion of just ﬁve residues
from the C-terminus of CED-4 prevented production of soluble
complex suggests that the interface for complex formation
includes the C-terminus of CED-4. In the APAF-1 structure,
the C-terminal residues are located on a short helix at the
opposite end of
the molecule to the N-terminus and,
importantly, are quite distinct from the other four protein
domains.23 Hence, the inability to produce soluble protein with
the short C-terminal deletion is unlikely due to failure of the
CED-4 proteins to fold, but is more likely due to a failure in the
assembly of the complex.

It

is known that CED-3 can bind to the CED-4/CED-9
complex7,31 and that activation of CED-3 occurs following
displacement of CED-9 and oligomerisation of CED-4. We have
shown that
the heterotetramer does not depend on the
presence of the N-terminal CARD of CED-4, which suggests
that in this complex it is ‘available’ to bind its cognate CARD on
CED-3. If this model holds for a ternary CED-3/CED-4/CED-9
complex anchored via CED-9 to the mitochondrial membrane,
then that complex would contain two molecules of CED-3,
apparently held in such a way that autoactivation is inhibited.
We have preliminary electron microscopy data showing that
the negatively stained CED-4/CED-9 complex is compact
(100–120 A˚ in diameter). Based on the molecular dimensions
of APAF-1, this suggests a side-by-side arrangement of the
CED-4 protomers in the heterotetramer, although no informa-
tion is available on the details. In a recent paper by Chao et al.,32
it was elegantly demonstrated that dimerisation of caspase-9
alone is not sufﬁcient for full activity (compared to APAF-1-
activated caspase-9).
Instead, an induced conformational

change may be more important. Thus, even a head-to-head or
parallel alignment (i.e. with the CED-4 CARD’s aligned) may
not sufﬁce to activate CED-3 without the stimulus of EGL-1,
and the resulting reorganisation of CED-4/CED-3.

We postulate an active role for CED-3 in controlling the
oligomerisation of CED-4, because in its absence, CED-4
forms insoluble aggregates on release from CED-9. Future
structural studies based on the results we have described
should provide further insight into the molecular mechanism of
this activation process.

Materials and Methods

Plasmid construction

The CED-4/CED-9 complex was coexpressed using the pET DUET-1 dual
expression vector (Novagen). The wild-type or mutant ced-4S cDNA’s
were subcloned into the ﬁrst multiple cloning site such that an N-terminal
hexahistidine tag was added to the protein, while the wild-type or mutant
FLAG-tagged ced-9 cDNA’s were subcloned into the second multiple
cloning site. Hexahistidine-tagged CED-9 (amino acids 68–251) was
produced using the pET 15b vector (Novagen). Mutagenesis of both
CED-4 and CED-9 was performed using the method of Kunkel et al.33 All
constructs were conﬁrmed by bidirectional automated DNA sequencing.

Protein expression and puriﬁcation

Proteins were expressed in BL-21(DE3) pLysS cells. For the CED-4/CED-9
coexpression, cells were grown from an overnight culture to an OD600 of
0.6–0.8 at 371C. Expression of proteins was then induced with 500 mM
isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside for 5 h at 251C after which cells were
pelleted and stored at  801C until required. Uncomplexed CED-9 was
expressed by induction at 371C for 3 h.

To purify the proteins, cell pellets were thawed and homogenised using
an Avestin EmulsiFlex homogeniser in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH
8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol: TBS/2ME). Following
centrifugation to remove cell debris, the supernatant was ﬁltered and then
pumped onto a 1 ml Hi-Trap (Amersham Biosciences) chelating column
charged with nickel. After washing the column with lysis buffer containing
20 mM imidazole,
the protein was eluted with lysis buffer containing
250 mM imidazole. The eluate was then further puriﬁed by gel-ﬁltration
chromatography on a Superdex 200 16/60 column (Amersham)
equilibrated and run in lysis buffer at 1 ml/min.

SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis

for 3 min prior

Proteins were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer
to
electrophoresis on precast 4–20% polyacrylamide gradient gels (Invitro-
gen). Gels were either stained directly in a Coomasie Brilliant Blue solution
or proteins transferred to PVDF membranes for Western blot analysis.
Membranes were probed using either anti-hexahistidine (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) or anti-FLAG M2 antibodies (Sigma) followed by anti-rabbit
or anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies.
Proteins were then visualised by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amer-
sham Biosciences).

CED-4/CED-9 complex dissociation assays

Studies on the dissociation of the CED-4/CED-9 complex were performed
by incubation of 50 mg of protein (0.5 mg/ml) with a two-fold molar excess

of synthetic BH3 domain peptide (supplied by Mimotopes) in a total volume
of 200 ml for 1 h at room temperature. The reaction mixture was then
centrifuged for 5 min at 13 000 rpm in a bench-top microfuge prior to
chromatography on a Superose 6 10/30 column equilibrated and run in
TBS/2ME at 0.5 ml/min.

Isothermal titration microcalorimetry

Isothermal titration microcalorimetry (ITC) studies were performed using a
MicroCal VP-ITC instrument. Proteins were diluted to 15 mM in TBS/2ME
and peptides (prepared in the same buffer from 2 mM stocks) were titrated
from a 120 mM solution. All experiments were performed at 251C. Data
analysis was performed using the MicroCal Origin software.

Analytical ultracentrifugation

Sedimentation experiments were conducted in a Beckman model XL-A
analytical ultracentrifuge at a temperature of 201C. Samples dissolved in
20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, pH 8.0 were loaded into a
conventional double sector quartz cell and mounted in a Beckman 4-hole
An-60 Ti rotor. For sedimentation velocity experiments, 380 ml of sample
(1.0 mg/ml) and 400 ml of reference solution were centrifuged at a rotor
speed of 40 000 rpm, and the data were collected at a single wavelength
(280 nm) in continuous mode, using a time interval of 300 s and a step-size
of 0.003 cm without averaging. For sedimentation equilibrium experi-
ments, 100 ml of sample (1.0 mg/ml) and 120 ml of
reference were
employed and the data were collected at a wavelength of 290 nm, rotor
velocity of 10 000 or 16 000 rpm, using a stepsize of 0.001 cm with 10
averages until sedimentation equilibrium was attained (B24 h). To
estimate the signal due to nonsedimenting contaminants, high-speed
depletion was performed at 40 000 rpm for 5 h following sedimentation
equilibrium, and the resulting baseline offset (E) was calculated by
averaging the absorbance over a radial range of 0.1 cm in the plateau
region adjacent to the sample meniscus. For all samples, the values for E
represented o 5% of the initial absorbance. Solvent density (1.005 g/ml at
201C) and viscosity (1.021 cp), as well as estimates of the partial speciﬁc
volume (0.734 ml/g) and hydration (0.402 g/g) of the CED-4/CED-9DNDC
complex were computed using the program SEDNTERP.34 Sedimentation
velocity data at multiple time points were ﬁtted to either a noninteracting
discrete species model of up to three components or a continuous size-
distribution model35 using the program SEDFIT, which is available at
www.analyticalultracentrifugation.com. Sedimentation equilibrium data at
multiple speeds were globally ﬁtted to single discrete species model by
employing the program SEDPHAT,36 which is similarly available.

N-terminal amino-acid sequencing

N-terminal amino-acid sequencing was performed using a Hewlett
Packard G1000A protein sequencer.

Co-immunoprecipitations

293T cells were transiently cotransfected with pcDNA3 vectors encoding
HA-tagged CED-4 and FLAG-tagged CED-9 and either EE-tagged-EGL-1
or EE-tagged BimS, both in pEF vectors. At 24 h post-transfection, CED-4/
CED-9 complexes were immunoprecipitated using a mouse M2 anti-FLAG
antibody (Sigma). Following SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred onto
nitrocellulose membranes and immunoblotted with either rat anti-HA 3F10
(Roche) or FLAG 9H1 antibodies.37
